According to IDC\'s prediction in 2013, the market for big data will reach $16.1 billion in 2014, growing 6 times faster than the overall IT market. This kind of business analysis reports brings great business opportunities and strong research interests among both academic and industry communities. Recently, a number of IEEE international conferences are organized focusing on Big Data Computing, Big Data Sciences and Analytics, and Big Data Technology and Engineering. Since emergent big data computing and services can be used in many disciplines and diverse applications, including business management, library science, energy and environment, education, biomedical, and healthcare and life science, social media and networking, smart city and travel, and transportation, etc.. Establishing and conducting successful big data projects in different domain applications require the following essential and critical entities:       -Various big data banks and resources with quality data collection, validation, evaluation and certification methods and standards.       -Scalable and efficient big data computing services.       -Well-defined domain-specific big data knowledge engineering and analytic intelligence.       -Well-developed big data infrastructures supported with high-quality big data DB technologies and tools. Unlike the other venues, this international conference is established to address the above needs for big data computing service researchers, domain-specific researchers, government agencies, and practitioners. The major objective is to provide a big platform for them to exchange innovation ideas and research results, and share application experiences and lessons. The three major objectives of this conference include:       -Big Data Innovation of big data computing and service models, theories, tools, solutions and technologies.       -Big Data and Service Sharing in big data banks and resources, portals, platforms, and open-sources, technology and tools.       -Big Data Application in real world big data application service projects for major application domains, including energy and environment, medical and healthcare, library, social media and networking, and education. This conference will include a three-day program with a well-defined track program, plus a number of invited keynote speeches from well-known speakers from the real world, as well as a CLOUD TECH SUMMIT with big data sessions.Jump to navigation Map Directory Calendar MyUW Library Tools UW Outlook365 Email UW Google Email Administrator\'s Toolbox Alpine Canvas Catalyst MeetingMaker Space Scout Panopto UUF Register for classes UW Seattle UW Bothell UW Tacoma patch icon University of washington | TacomaUniversity of washington | TacomaUniversity of washington | Tacoma Institute of Technology Search form Search Toggle Institute of Technology Home Programs Computer Science and Systems Information Technology and Systems Computer Engineering and Systems Cybersecurity and Leadership Research Areas of Faculty Research Graduate Student Research Center for Brazilian Studies Center for Data Science Center for Information Assurance and Cybersecurity (CIAC) Security and Privacy Research and Outreach Group (SPROG) Student Resources Student Resources Student Employee Resources Internships Careers Scholarships Student Mentors Program Student Organizations Technology Labs Faculty/Staff Resources Faculty Resources Staff Resources Institute Improvement Initiative People Faculty & Staff Directory Institute of Technology Advisory Board Alumni About About the Institute of Technology History of the Institute of Technology Goals Mission, Vision and Values Community Outreach News Contact You are here Home › Institute of Technology Institute of Technology CDS2.jpg Learn more about the Center for Data Science slide2.png Learn more about the B.S. and B.A. in Computer Science and Systems MCL2.jpg Learn more about the Master in Cybersecurity and Leadership (MCL) degree program slide3.png Learn more about the B.S. in Information Technology and Systems slide5.png Learn more about the B.S. in Computer Engineering and Systems 7EBG4824.jpg Learn more about the Master of Science in Computer Science and Systems slide6.png   DEGREES Computer Science and Systems BA/BS Computer Engineering and Systems BS Information Technology and Systems BS Computer Science and Systems MS Master of Cybersecurity and Leadership RESEARCH Center for Data Science STAY CONNECTED INSTITUTE CALENDAR          Institute of Technology The Institute of Technology at the University of Washington, Tacoma, provides focus for the rapid development of high-technology academic programs which serve the needs of the state of Washington.

Recent Events Please join us in congratulating Yiru Li, Sarah George, Craig Apfelbeck, Abdeltawab Hendawi, David Hazel, Ankur Teredesai and Mohamed Ali on winning the \"Best Demo\" award at the ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS Conference 2014  on the iTornado system. The paper is titled: “Routing Service With Real World Severe Weather” and presents a framework for routing services to evacuate vehicles under real world severe weather threats. The system is able to: (1) Identify the users inside the dangerous region of a severe weather event, (2) Recommend an evacuation route to guide the users out to a safe destination or shelter, (3) Assure the recommended route to be one of the shortest paths after excluding the risky area, and  (4) Maintain the flow of traffic by normalizing the evacuation on the possible safe routes. For additional information, please visit the Geospatial Data Management page of the Center for Data Science: http://cwds.uw.edu/geospatial-data-management” Dr. George Mobus, Associate Professor in Computer Science & Systems and Computer Engineering & Systems, has just had his textbook (along with co-author Professor Emeritus Michael Kalton of IAS) entitled Principles of Systems Science published by Springer, New York. This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. The book contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. Please join us in congratulating Dr. Mobus on this major accomplishment.

Older posts PISA provides Turkey with good news, bad news, and lessons Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in Today’s Zaman Decem­ber  22, 2013 (with Turan Kayao?lu) Two weeks ago, the Organ­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co-??operation and Devel­op­ment (OECD) released country-??level results from its 2012 Pro­gramme for Inter­na­tional Stu­dent Assess­ment (PISA). What typ­i­cally fol­lows in most news cov­er­age is hand­wring­ing and awk­ward expla­na­tions, as few receive the hoped-??for good news. Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Education, International Profit motive drives US health-??care cost disparities Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, June 19, 2013 Back when he was pres­i­dent, Ronald Rea­gan famously (or infa­mously) took to reduc­ing com­plex con­cepts to sim­ple ones the pub­lic could eas­ily understand. For instance, to explain the size of our nation’s debt, which in 1981 had just topped $1 tril­lion, he sum­moned the image of one tril­lion dol­lar bills stacked one on top of the other. My mind’s eye still can see that tower of bills reach­ing up beyond the stratos­phere, extend­ing one-??quarter of the way to the moon. Con­tinue read­ing ?

Pick your favorite metaphor to describe the ongo­ing, seem­ingly never-??ending “nego­ti­a­tions” occur­ring in Olympia over the state’s bud­get. So bor­ing, unevent­ful, and secre­tive are these pur­ported dis­cus­sions that even polit­i­cal scribes are find­ing lit­tle of inter­est to report on. The Legislature’s 30-??day spe­cial ses­sion, the sole pur­pose of which is to approve a bud­get, is now set to expire in less than a week. Con­tinue read­ing ?

Crit­ics of the United States like to sin­gle out our large dis­par­i­ties in life out­comes as evi­dence of our country’s moral fail­ures. As dis­turb­ing as dif­fer­ences in income and wealth are, we Amer­i­cans remain wed­ded to our foun­da­tional story: With hard work and a large dose of deter­mi­na­tion, even the poor­est among us can climb the social ladder. We prob­a­bly each can recite such a Hor­a­tio Alger story. I see them each year in my class­room, where sit immi­grants who have fled poverty and con­flict, hav­ing exchanged it for the secu­rity and suc­cess our coun­try offers them. Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Education, Higher Education, Tacoma, Washington State Praising math successes part of fostering big change Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, April 24, 2013. There’s an increas­ing drum­beat around mak­ing sure all high school stu­dents grad­u­ate with solid math skills. You could hear it in News Tri­bune arti­cles this month. One (“Math prob­lems are a prob­lem for job-??seekers, employ­ers say,”, 4–4) described how some local employ­ers require their employ­ees to have a basic grasp of math, but were find­ing that most high school grad­u­ates did not. In another we learned that 16,000 of the state’s high school seniors have yet to pass the state math test, and thus may not grad­u­ate (“Thou­sands might not grad­u­ate because of WA math test,” 4–15). It so hap­pens that between the pub­li­ca­tion of these two arti­cles, I found myself in Yakima attend­ing the Wash­ing­ton State Math Council’s annual State Math­e­mat­ics Con­tests.

When employ­ers gain the lion’s share of the value cre­ated in the work­place, we com­monly call this eco­nomic exploita­tion. Slav­ery is the extreme exam­ple, but exploita­tion can occur when work­ers gain some­thing more than zero per­cent of what is produced. A nation’s “wage share” pro­vides a rough approx­i­ma­tion of how the value of what a coun­try pro­duces is split between work­ers and employ­ers. In the United States, the wage share is about 58 percent. Bear with me a minute, because I’m now going to relate this to March Mad­ness. Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Education, Higher Education, Washington State As inequality in the US grows, the rest of the world progesses Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, March 27, 2013 Two months ago, econ­o­mists from around the world con­verged in San Diego for their annual con­ven­tion. Dozens pre­sented papers on the hot topic of grow­ing income inequal­ity in the United States. These papers led to lively and at times heated debates, some of which have sub­se­quently spilled over onto blogs as well as the nation’s opin­ion pages. The ten­dency to focus on the U.S. and our trou­bling upward trend in inequal­ity is a nat­ural one. But it also misses aston­ish­ing progress on the inequal­ity front. Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Inequality, International, Social Policy That rising tide seems to be missing a lot of boats Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, March 14, 2013. Another encour­ag­ing sign of slow eco­nomic recov­ery came last week from the Bureau of Labor Sta­tis­tics (BLS). It reported that nation­wide, Feb­ru­ary expe­ri­enced a net increase of 236,000 new jobs. A year ago, unemploy-??ment sat at 8.3 per­cent; today it is 7.7 per­cent. A painfully slow improve­ment, for sure, but at least the labor mar­ket is headed in the right direction. Or is it? Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Fiscal Policy, Inequality, Social Policy We can save much grief by getting ahead of social problems Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, Feb­ru­ary 27, 2013. Each year as a nation, we spend more than $150 bil­lion on research to find health-??improving prod­ucts. Such research has led to spec­tac­u­lar advance­ments in the health of those born pre­ma­turely or afflicted with heart dis­ease, dia­betes or cancer. Yet when it comes to pro­mot­ing a healthy pop­u­la­tion, we shouldn’t be so quick to con­grat­u­late our­selves. Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Health Care Policy, Inequality, Social Policy State’s future tuition program caught in conundrum Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, Feb­ru­ary 13, 2013 Only make promises you can keep. That’s good, solid advice.  In light of what we now know about Washington’s embat­tled Guar­an­teed Edu­ca­tion Tuition (GET) pro­gram, we might mod­ify that to some­thing along the lines of “Only make promises you won’t regret keeping.” The good thing about GET is that it reduces the finan­cial uncer­tainty asso­ci­ated with col­lege by allow­ing any­one to pay for tuition at a set price today, and receive the value of tuition — what­ever that might be — tomor­row.  In this way GET has helped many Wash­ing­to­ni­ans plan for the expense of col­lege.

Posted in Education, Washington State Congress needs to engage in some real tax reform Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, Jan­u­ary 3, 2013 This week we avoided that plunge over the fis­cal cliff.  Not only did Democ­rats and Repub­li­cans reach a con­sen­sus that taxes must increase, but in a final dra­matic hour they even agreed on the specifics. But it’s not yet time to breathe easy as the para­chute we’re on is only half opened.  The tax code changes Con­gress agreed to are mea­ger and a far cry from the true tax reform we need. Recall that our “fis­cal cliff” dilemma was cre­ated to give Con­gress a hard dead­line for get­ting our fis­cal house in order.  But iron­i­cally, the dead­line caused both Democ­rats and Repub­li­cans to focus exclu­sively on the dead­line itself and its reper­cus­sions, rather than on our fis­cal house.

Posted in Fiscal Policy Untreated mental illness raises the risk factors for violence Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, Decem­ber 19, 2012 The news from New­town, Con­necti­cut has many of us revis­it­ing recent hor­rors where unsta­ble cit­i­zens in our own com­mu­ni­ties com­mit­ted the unspeak­able crime of killing off-??duty police offi­cers, a sleep­ing father, a park ranger, and far too many oth­ers.  Yet even these sense­less crimes pale in com­par­i­son with the ter­ri­fy­ing vio­lence vis­ited last week on chil­dren at Sandy Hook Ele­men­tary School. New York Times colum­nist Nicholas Kristof pas­sion­ately, pre­dictably — and cor­rectly – has called for stricter con­trol and reg­u­la­tion of our nation’s guns.  Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Health Care Policy, Social Policy Leaders need to take a long-??term look at budget crisis Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, Decem­ber 5, 2012 As just about every­one knows, Repub­li­cans and Democ­rats are squar­ing off to decide whether to take the nation on a plunge over a so-??called fis­cal cliff, or come to a screech­ing halt at the rim by agree­ing to siz­able spend­ing cuts and tax increases.  If reached, such an agree­ment could allow us gen­tly to glide down our huge moun­tain of national debt in a more pain­less fash­ion than would the alternative. While the lat­ter hurl-??ourselves-??over-??the-??edge option would quite dra­mat­i­cally reduce our bud­get deficits — at least tem­porar­ily — the con­se­quent “splat” at the bot­tom (sharp declines in spend­ing) would likely set off a reces­sion. Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Fiscal Policy It’s unfair to group the ‘welfare state’ into single lump Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, Novem­ber 22, 2012 Often, hol­i­day meals like those at my house con­sist of a range of sep­a­rate con­tri­bu­tions which col­lec­tively add up to the Thanks­giv­ing Din­ner.  As we sit down to par­take of the var­ied assort­ment of dishes, no one would think of crit­i­ciz­ing the turkey because the mush­room soup dish con­tained more fried onion rings than green beans, or because some­one insisted on adding a bag of marsh­mel­lows to the sweet potatoes. The fact that dif­fer­ent dishes are on the same table doesn’t some­how turn them into one “Dish” called “Thanks­giv­ing Din­ner” that deserves a sin­gu­lar judg­ment.   Instead, we pass judg­ment on the suc­cess­ful (and qui­etly per­haps, the less suc­cess­ful) fea­tures of each indi­vid­ual dish.  Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Health Care Policy, Inequality, Social Policy Misguided drug policies can create tragic, unintended consequences Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, Novem­ber 8, 2012 As part of an intro­duc­tory course in eco­nom­ics, I used to teach my stu­dents about the unin­tended con­se­quences that usu­ally accom­pany well-??intentioned attempts to make par­tic­u­lar trans­ac­tions ille­gal.  I would draw on cur­rent drug pol­icy to link the­ory with reality. One thing that I learned from these con­ver­sa­tions was that many stu­dents felt that dis­cussing the pros and cons of drug legal­iza­tion was immoral.  This sort of belief is one of the chal­lenges we’ve faced in con­fronting fail­ures in our drug policies. Tuesday’s pas­sage of ini­tia­tives in Wash­ing­ton (I-??502) and Col­orado to legal­ize recre­ational mar­i­juana usage offer promis­ing signs that change is now in the air.  Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Social Policy, Washington State Rising inequality partly to blame for stagnant economy Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, Octo­ber 25, 2012 Are we bet­ter off today than we were four years ago?   For too many peo­ple, the answer is no. As dis­ap­point­ing as this fact is, it’s mostly due to the cycles that mod­ern economies are prone to.  Four years ago we had just passed a cycle’s crest; today we’re slowly climb­ing out of its trough.  To com­pare these two peri­ods is to con­trast two points in the economy’s short term ups and downs. This detail of course doesn’t make it any eas­ier for those suf­fer­ing through this cycle.  It’s just that such a per­spec­tive doesn’t reveal much about the true direc­tion in which our econ­omy is headed.   Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Inequality, Social Policy Op-??ed: Approve Initiative 1240 to allow public charter schools Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The Seat­tle Times, Octo­ber 22, 2012 Three pre­vi­ous swings at estab­lish­ing pub­lic char­ter schools in Wash­ing­ton came up empty, so why are pro­po­nents for them still at bat? Pas­sion for char­ter schools is part of the rea­son Ini­tia­tive 1240 is on the Nov. 6 bal­lot. Another rea­son is that hope springs eter­nal — a chang­ing polit­i­cal envi­ron­ment opens up new pos­si­bil­i­ties and with it, per­haps, a dif­fer­ent out­come. Finally, a new cam­paign for char­ters might suc­ceed in dis­pelling com­mon argu­ments against them that could change the debate. One com­mon argu­ment is that there’s no evi­dence the aver­age pub­lic char­ter school out­per­forms tra­di­tional pub­lic schools. While true, this fact shouldn’t lead to the con­clu­sion that char­ters aren’t good for Washington’s chil­dren. Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Education, Inequality, Washington State We must give our trust to educators, but we must verify the results Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, Octo­ber 11, 2012 What Pres­i­dent Ronald Rea­gan liked to say about our rela­tions with the Soviet Union, “Trust, but ver­ify” is also true of edu­ca­tion.  This is why I think the char­ter school ini­tia­tive, I-??1240, is a good idea:  it strength­ens our trust in schools and it pro­vides new ways to ver­ify that this trust is deserved. Com­par­ing inter­na­tional rela­tions and nego­ti­a­tions over nuclear dis­ar­ma­ment treaties with edu­ca­tion and char­ters schools deserves expla­na­tion.  To do that let’s turn back the clock.  Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Education, Inequality, Washington State A citizen’s worth cannot be measured by simple arithmetic Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, Sep­tem­ber 21, 2012 A col­league of mine bought a cup of cof­fee at the local cof­fee joint this week.  A moment later, cup in hand, she left the shop only to return a minute later to pay for three more.  She’d seen some con­tract work­ers out­side clean­ing up cam­pus in antic­i­pa­tion of the pend­ing arrival of our stu­dents.  On the spot she some­how decided that these new­com­ers to cam­pus would appre­ci­ate some cof­fee.  After pay­ing for their three cups, she informed them cof­fee would await them dur­ing their break, and then off she went to put in a day’s work. Now I don’t know if Jean­nie is among the 47 per­cent of Amer­i­cans who don’t owe income taxes.  But I do know that pay­ing taxes is only one of many ways that cit­i­zens make valu­able con­tri­bu­tions to our soci­ety. Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Social Policy, Tax Policy Look to Europe to improve our educational system Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, August 29, 2012 Look­ing to Euro­pean coun­tries for pol­icy advice these days might seem like an untimely under­tak­ing.  But when it comes to edu­ca­tion, Europe is a key place to watch.  And we’d be well advised to not just pay atten­tion, but to climb aboard the same band­wagon that so many Euro­pean nations are now on. Over the last sev­eral decades many Euro­pean coun­tries have made great strides in improv­ing their edu­ca­tional sys­tems.  This has been evi­dent not just in inter­na­tional test scores, but also in the grow­ing num­ber of years their stu­dents remain in school. Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Education, International To be better informed, state voters could use a little nudge Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, August 15, 2012 A con­cept referred to as “nudge” has been get­ting some atten­tion lately.  This is because the two pro­fes­sors who coined the term wrote a book (unsur­pris­ingly called Nudge) that explains it to a gen­eral audience. The basic claim in Nudge is that in a wide range of sit­u­a­tions gov­ern­ments should “nudge” peo­ple into mak­ing bet­ter choices.  Turn­ing to the recent elec­tion results, I’d argue that Wash­ing­ton State res­i­dents would ben­e­fit from a lit­tle nudg­ing so that we cast more informed votes. Con­tinue read­ing ? Posted in Washington State Court ruling could leave state’s poor without access to health care, Posted on August 23, 2014 by kebaird Pub­lished in The News Tri­bune, August 2, 2012 The Supreme Court’s deci­sion this sum­mer to uphold the most con­tro­ver­sial part of the Afford­able Care Act (ACA) – the “man­date” requir­ing indi­vid­u­als to buy health insur­ance – was both his­toric and a crit­i­cal vic­tory for those bat­tling to achieve uni­ver­sal health care in the United States. How­ever, while most of the public’s atten­tion has rightly focused on the Court’s deter­mi­na­tion that the fed­eral gov­ern­ment can indeed require us to buy health insur­ance, this wasn’t the only pro­vi­sion in the ACA that oppo­nents argued was uncon­sti­tu­tional:   They also claimed that the ACA’s expan­sion of Med­ic­aid to more of the nation’s poor coerced states’ par­tic­i­pa­tion by set­ting the penalty for non­par­tic­i­pa­tion too high.

However, widespread and injudicious use of pesticides is detrimental to the environment, poses a health risk, and undermines biocontrol services. Researchers are increasingly required to develop techniques to quantify the trade-offs and risks associated with pesticides. Laboratory studies, though useful for assessing short-term impacts (e.g., mortality), cannot detect longer-term or indirect effects that can potentially be assessed using semifield studies. Here we review the range and scope of studies that have used semifield methods for regulatory testing and risk assessment of pesticides and for understanding the community-level effects of pesticide use in agricultural landscapes. We include studies on target and nontarget species, with an emphasis on quantifying effects when the target species is highly mobile. We suggest improvements in the design and analysis of semifield studies to more effectively assess effects on highly mobile species.

HOW LONG FOR SHOULD I MONITOR AFTER APPLICATION? TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments The availability of agricultural pesticides (such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides) since the 1940s is one factor that has enabled farmers to produce large amounts of high-quality food and fiber (97). Today, many agricultural producers rely on regular pesticide applications to avoid losses from pests and diseases. Unfortunately, widespread injudicious use of pesticides has been detrimental to the environment (97–99). Of 13 components of agricultural intensification measured in Europe, insecticides and fungicides had consistent negative effects on biodiversity and biological control potential (40). In the United States, researchers have found a strong link between landscape simplification (high proportion of cropland in the landscape), pest pressure, and insecticide use (85). Such studies have highlighted the potential negative impacts pesticides can have on our environment (98), and have encouraged greater efforts to assess the risks associated with pesticides. Farmers are under increasing pressure from governments, as well as environmentally focused special interest groups, to reduce their impact on the environment, or at least justify relatively harmful pesticide use. Semifield methods (e.g., small-plot trials, nontarget testing, exclusion cages) are important tools for addressing these issues and, when used in combination with other testing methods, can help evaluate the effect of pesticides on nontarget species, ecological communities, and the environment (4). Semifield studies, although difficult to strictly define (see below), are often used to assess the effects of pesticides because they are economically and statistically tractable. But can they provide us with adequate information to quantify the effects of pesticides? These effects may include changes in abundance or distribution of pest and nontarget species, changes to the structure and function of ecological communities, and broader environmental impacts. The primary aim of a pesticide application is to reduce the population of a target pest species to below economic injury levels. If successful, this will not only lead to less plant damage but also reduce the availability of prey for other species in the community (137). Therefore, it is not surprising that nontarget species may be affected by the pesticide application both directly and indirectly (105). To determine the overall effect of a pesticide, one must not only observe a reduction in target individuals after pesticide application, but also evaluate unintended consequences for other species in the community. Furthermore, we need to assess whether the trade-off in terms of a reduction in natural enemies (predatory and parasitic invertebrates) (80), and potential resurgence of secondary pests (52, 137, 138), is warranted given the current economic losses and future pest risks (132). It is not surprising that researchers designing semifield studies will always make certain compromises owing to experimental constraints. The objective of our review is to help researchers understand the strengths and limitations of design choices and thus better articulate the scope and intent of future studies. What Are Semifield Studies and Why Are They Important? Semifield studies are used both for regulatory testing and risk assessment of new plant protection products and for understanding the community-level impacts of pesticides as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) program. They provide essential information for how we manage pests in agricultural landscapes. Risk assessments of conventional pesticides and genetically modified crops usually involve a tiered process of toxicity testing that begins in the laboratory, progresses to semifield studies, and culminates in open-field studies in agricultural systems (105, 118). If laboratory tests reveal a potential hazard, more complex semifield studies should be carried out. In this context semifield methods involve single-species tests (usually a nontarget species) using enclosures in the laboratory or cages in the field (20). The test substance is applied in the same manner as in a commercial situation, and overall survival and sublethal effects on the test species are assessed. Semifield methods are also used more broadly to understand the community-level impacts of pesticides. The aim is to quantify the trade-offs associated with pesticide application in an open system, or the selectivity of a chemical for use in an IPM program (72, 140). IPM relies on, among other factors, the use of natural enemies to attack and kill pest invertebrates. In practice, the information that farmers require to assess the likely impact of one chemical on natural enemy populations is usually unavailable. Aspects of the regulatory testing procedure (outlined above) can sometimes be useful to scientists developing IPM programs, especially in cases in which a product has progressed to the semifield testing stage (4, 64). Attempts are being made to synthesize what little published information is available on the effects of pesticides on natural enemies into useful extension materials for farmers (14, 139) (and we suspect there is a large contribution from unpublished data). This may involve ranking different pesticides according to their impact on natural enemy species and quantifying the extent of effects across the invertebrate community (e.g., 83, 125). A strict definition of semifield studies is problematic because it must encompass a wide range of experimental designs and spatial scales (Figure 1) (Table 1). Semifield studies sit in the middle of the pesticide risk assessment spectrum, between basic laboratory studies that test the direct effect of a pesticide and large-scale real-world studies that observe impacts from commercial usage patterns (64) (Figure 1). Candolfi et al. (20) documented the regulatory testing and interpretation of field and semifield studies that reflected the opinions of a range of experts drawn together for a workshop on this topic in 1999. The authors describe the basic elements of semifield methods, which include a test system (treated indoors or outdoors) and test organisms that are initially maintained in the field (20). Schaeffer et al. (109) similarly suggest that semifield studies involve controlled, reproducible test systems that in some way simulate interactions between components of the terrestrial environment, either in the laboratory or in the field. We have expanded this definition to include studies in field plots that use naturally occurring invertebrate communities or organisms released just prior to the treatment. A range of techniques aim to determine the impact of pesticides on populations at the mesoscale under realistic environmental conditions (Figure 1). One main advantage of semifield studies is that they allow us to assess both direct and indirect impacts of pesticides simultaneously (see sidebar, Limitations of Laboratory Studies on the Effects of Pesticides) (63, 64). Figure 1? Temporal and spatial scales for the process of contamination by pesticides (depicted by arrow along the top). Semifield studies operate within the Meso space between acute laboratory testing (Micro) and large-scale field studies (Macro). Figure adapted with permission from Reference 64. Table 1? Usefulness of semifield experimental designs for examining the effects of pesticides according to objective criteriaa Why Single Out Mobile Invertebrates? Although it is possible to carry out a semifield study that shows the effect of a pesticide on a species without any knowledge of the mobility of that species, even a basic understanding of the species\' movement ecology may allow us to infer something about the mechanisms underlying the pesticide effects observed (110). Furthermore, for species that are highly mobile, the results of semifield studies may be misinterpreted, and we risk concluding that there is no pesticide effect when in fact our methodology was not adequate to detect it. Ecologists have long understood the importance of incorporating movement into invertebrate population dynamics (37, 76, 93, 132). Movement processes may be divided into two categories: (a) migratory, often connoting long-term dispersal that may be triggered by seasonal or habitat/environmental cues or built into life-history strategies; or (b) local, sometimes referred to as trivial movement (22, 56, 110). The latter is commonly found in agroecosystems and is often a response to changes in resource availability and quality, which is common in cases of intercropping or trap-cropping strategies (113). Pesticide use can greatly affect resource/habitat quality for invertebrates and hence movement must be carefully considered in any discussion of field studies of pesticides. Levins (77) originally developed the metapopulation framework, widely used in conservation biology, to tackle pest control problems. Metapopulation theory describes a group of distinct populations governed by their own birth-death dynamics but linked via dispersal or movement, and Levins (77) proposed that an effective spray regimen to control arthropod pests in agricultural ecosystems must consider the nuances of dispersal among habitats (e.g., crop patches). Subsequent applications of this framework have focused on using metapopulation models to bolster the conservation of rare or endangered species (e.g., 54). Recent versions of these models describe how trade-offs between dispersal and competition coupled with habitat loss may lead to a so-called extinction debt (126), whereby a species currently present in certain habitat fragments but ultimately unable to sustain itself will eventually go extinct. This modified framework has so far been applied most often to plant interactions; however, there may be meaningful applications in pest control, especially in systems where high population densities trigger dispersal behaviors above certain thresholds, as occurs in aphid pests of annual cropping systems (26). Regardless of the degree of habitat heterogeneity found in agricultural landscapes, it is critically important to examine interactions between pesticide use and invertebrate behavior if we want to assess the effectiveness of pesticides (50). Pesticide applications affect the behavior of pests, natural enemies (25, 136), and nontarget species (27, 116). Herbivorous pests that do not suffer acute mortality may alter their behavior by moving away from areas treated with a pesticide (repellency; 84). Exposure to pesticides may alter activity levels, with greater levels of activity observed by predators searching for scarcer prey. For example, insecticide application increases the short-term activity of predatory beetles in some cases (25) and reduces foraging activity/movement in others (9). Because the interface of foraging ability/dispersal and habitat heterogeneity (including crop dispersion) is a major determinant of pest survival (e.g., 19), there is a clear need to include spatially explicit elements, the sort that are easily incorporated into semifield studies, in empirical approaches to understanding pest control. Although adapting semifield study methodologies specifically for understanding the effects of pesticides on mobile invertebrates may be challenging, this will ultimately lead to a mechanistic understanding of the impact of pesticide use on agroecosystems.

TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments We utilized a variety of methods to collate the terrestrial semifield studies included in this review, such as Web of Knowledge searches (using a range of terms) to access published literature and articles solicited directly from researchers. We focused on highly mobile invertebrate pests of crop plants; we did not cover animal parasites. Studies that did not fit our definition of a semifield study (see Figure 1) were excluded from this review. These included purely laboratory-based toxicity studies (e.g., 29, 75) as well as relatively large natural experiments using whole fields (e.g., 21, 71, 103). We excluded studies that were limited solely to pre-sow applications, seed dressings, and baits, and did not actively search for studies that assessed the impacts of transgenic crops expressing an insecticide (e.g., the impact of Bt cotton varieties), unless foliar insecticides were included (e.g., 31, 32). We have made no assessment of different sampling methodologies for invertebrates used in the semifield studies, but we acknowledge that this is another factor that may affect our ability to detect the effects of pesticides. For a quantitative analysis of field-plot semifield studies (Figure 2) we searched the 2005 and 2010 volumes of Arthropod Management Tests, focusing just on the field crops and cereals section (section F) (http://www.entsoc.org/Pubs/Periodicals/AMT). In addition, we manually downloaded and searched the open-access IOBC Working Group “Pesticides and Beneficial Organisms” bulletins for the years 2000–2004 (http://www.iobc-wprs.org/pub/bulletins/index.html).

TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments Artificially Assembled Systems (Test Subjects Collected from the Field) One defining feature of artificially assembled systems is that all organisms are known and controlled by the researcher. We have included in this methodology the use of excised plant material or potted plants moved into the laboratory or greenhouse that are exposed to a pesticide (e.g., 62, 86, 87). These bioassays usually involve caging a test subject(s) on the plant material and examining the lethal and sublethal effects of the pesticide(s) (13). They are well suited to following the fate and behavior of chemicals through an artificial ecosystem (109). The test subject is prevented from moving away from the container, and so these types of studies illustrate the maximum likely exposure that any individual might receive over a short period (Table 1). Desneux et al. (30) delayed the introduction of parasitoids onto potted oilseed rape plants that had been sprayed with an insecticide 1, 2, 7, or 14 days prior to determine the impact of spray residues on parasitoid activity and the mortality of aphid populations on the plants. Moll & Schuld (87) similarly used potted barley seedlings with different insecticide regimens to assess the impact of their residues on parasitoid reproduction. Aphid parasitoids were caged on the differently treated plants, and after 24, 48, and 72 h, new seedlings infested with aphids were introduced. This allowed a dose-response relationship to be elucidated. Brévault et al. (15) used potted cotton plants sprayed with an insecticide in the laboratory to assess competition between two aphid genotypes, with the insecticide application reducing the relative abundance of one of these genotypes on the experimental plants. Terrestrial Model Ecosystems A range of model ecosystems constructed in or brought back to the laboratory and manipulated under controlled environments have been used to study the effects of pesticides on invertebrate communities. They have developed from the mesocosm idea described by Odum (91) in which bounded and partially enclosed units can be used to study parts of an ecosystem with some degree of realism. The aim of a mesocosm design is to try to maintain some components of an intact community while manipulating other components. More recently, the term terrestrial model ecosystem (TME) has been used to describe these designs and separate them from aquatic mesocosm and microcosm studies. A TME is usually housed in a climate chamber or a greenhouse (although they can be maintained outside for at least a year; 111) and aims to simulate ecosystem components. TMEs involve multiple species and therefore enable interactions between species to be studied in a controlled manner (Table 1). TMEs close the gap between simple laboratory-based exposure studies and field-based assessments. For example, Förster et al. (39) examined the impact of ivermectin on soil invertebrates using intact soil cores extracted from pastures and then exposed to different concentrations of the pesticide. In this case, the semifield test results supported laboratory analyses, which in general demonstrated low to moderate ivermectin effects on soil organism abundance. Although this technique has been commonly used to study the effects of pesticides on soil communities using intact soil cores (e.g., 39, 61, 111), it could be used more extensively for mobile aboveground invertebrates as long as the scale is large enough (e.g., a greenhouse). Because TMEs involve multiple species and the ability to control the environment, they are potentially more useful for regulatory testing than single-species laboratory exposure studies (133). Field Cages or Enclosures A range of cages and enclosures (44, 68) in the field have been used to assess the effects of pesticides on encapsulated communities. These can be as small as clip cages that house a few mites on a leaf or as large as cages that encompass trees or multiple crop rows, and can be entirely closed or simply restrict movement of the target organisms. Wiles & Jepson (135) describe the use of enclosures for in situ field bioassay protocols. A modified petri dish constructed around a sprayed cereal leaf was used to confine coccinellid and carabid beetles to assess the effect of spray residues on their activity in the field. A larger plastic chamber was designed to confine more than one sprayed leaf and multiple aphid predators. Brévault et al. (15) used field cages (250 × 250 × 250 cm) in cotton fields to restrict movement of two competing aphid genotypes. The plants inside the cages were then sprayed with an insecticide to assess effects and determine whether one genotype was more tolerant than the other. Heimbach et al. (58) describe a semifield method to test the effects of pesticides on carabids using small square (50 × 50 cm) metal frames buried in the ground into which the beetles were released. Kennedy et al. (68) compared large open plots (1 ha or greater) to small enclosures (10 × 10 m) in cereal fields for testing the effects of insecticides on predators. The authors concluded that large open plots were preferable to small enclosed plots due to the high variability in the number of predators captured with pitfall traps placed in the enclosed plots. Pullen et al. (101) used an area enclosed in a barrier within sprayed field plots to assess reinvasion of treated areas. Densities of invertebrates inside the barrier were consistently lower than those in the open field that received the same treatment (94). If field edges act as similar barriers to reinvasion, then whole-field commercial treatments may be more detrimental to target species recovery than suggested by small-plot experiments. Field Plots Semifield studies involving replicated plots (often in a randomized complete block design) with different treatments (e.g., plots sprayed with pesticides and controls) are perhaps the most common form of semifield studies (e.g., 48, 67, 81, 88, 96, 104, 130). They are used in a variety of agricultural contexts (broad-acre crops, vegetables, orchards, and vineyards) and allow modern statistical techniques to be applied during data analyses. The constraints of field-plot studies have been summarized by Macfadyen & Zalucki (82) (Table 1). The treatments are composed of a test item (a single chemical or combination of chemicals), a toxic standard to demonstrate the relative susceptibility of the test subjects (although it is not always included; e.g., 86), and a control in which no applications (e.g., 40, 82, 137) or a solvent (e.g., water; 6, 78) is used. Generally, most agronomic inputs are managed by the researchers, although they are often placed in commercial fields. One criticism of these designs is that plot sizes are often too small for the organisms involved (66). This leads to movement between plots, which means each plot is no longer statistically independent from the other, especially when posttreatment redistribution of target species from one plot to another may yield misleading results about the effects of a given strategy (11, 96). The ideal experimental design would be one in which each treatment plot is as large as practically possible and all treatments are fully replicated. However, this is often logistically impossible. Brown (17) examined simultaneously the impact of pesticides on replicated small plots (30 trees) and unreplicated large plots (150 trees) in orchards and found that the trends in relation to natural enemies were clearer in the large plots. Smart et al. (115) suggest that larger plots (they used 8,400 m2), even with reduced replication, are better than small plots for assessing the effects of pesticides on mobile species (also see 79). The trade-off between plot size and replication is particularly important if duration of impact is to be examined (63 and references therein). Rapid reinvasion of small plots following treatment means that only short-term effects can be monitored (Table 1). For example, Pullen et al. (101) found that for linyphiid spiders significant treatment effects were observed for 89 days in 1-ha plots, but up to 168 days in 4-ha plots. Split-Fields Split-field (or half-field) studies are generally conducted on commercial fields owned by a landholder who has agreed to take part in a study, which limits the amount of control the researcher has on the agronomic practices and inputs but is relatively realistic (e.g., 2, 134) (Table 1). A variation on this design is when a farmer is asked to leave an unsprayed strip of crop in a field treated with a pesticide (102). This unsprayed strip is used as the control plot, although depending on the plot dimensions, allowances for the effect of spray drift should be made (73). A split-field design avoids the problem of finding suitably matched pairs of fields and allows increased sampling efficiency (because the two sites are relatively close together). However, presampling of large field trials is recommended to ensure that there is sufficient abundance and diversity of arthropods (70). The UK Farm Scale Evaluations of Genetically Modified Herbicide Tolerant (GMHT) crops is perhaps the most comprehensive study to use split-fields, with 60–75 fields of each crop type and treatments (GMHT or conventional) randomly allocated to each field site (16, 57). Few studies have examined the effects of pesticides on mobile invertebrates at this highly informative scale. Although within-field movement of large and highly mobile arthropods is not uncommon (121), for some species, movement between the two field halves may be less than the movement in small field-plot studies. Volkmar et al. (131) used a split-field design to examine the effects of reducing insecticide sprays by 50% on Araneae species diversity, activity, and density over a four-year period. They concluded that reducing the insecticide inputs by 50% over the long term would have a positive effect on spider communities. In contrast, Schumacher & Freier (112) used a similar approach to examine the effects of halving pesticide doses on aphids and their predators in a single field over three years. They found that the aphids benefited more from the reduced insecticide doses than their predators did, and no accumulated effects over time were found. IS MY PLOT SIZE LARGE ENOUGH? Top of page INTRODUCTION METHODS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IS MY PLOT SIZE LARGE ENOUGH? HOW LONG FOR SHOULD I MONITOR AFTER APPLICATION? TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments There will always be highly mobile taxa for which even very large plots will be too small (17), and the area available for experimentation is usually limited by available space and/or cost (40, 79). The issue is whether practical compromises made during experimental design limit our ability to detect the effects of pesticides on a target species or community. Therefore, making definitive statements in relation to minimum plot size is unhelpful. However, the multitude of previous studies gives us a baseline from which to choose a plot size that enables us to be confident about detecting effects when they do occur. For example, a summary of field-plot studies (86) examining the impact of spinosad on predatory mites found that field plots ranged from 10 to 15 grapevines, or from 4 to 24 orchard trees. The degree of replication was similar (4, 6) across trials (86). Some investigations use a range of plot sizes as part of their study, or as a preliminary study, to determine whether the ultimate plot size is large enough to detect effects. For example, Brown (17) examined the impact of pesticides on orchard arthropods using small (30 trees per plot) and large (150 trees per plot) field plots and concluded that Stethorus larvae (a predator species of spider mites) may live in just one tree; however, anthocorid nymphs may need many. Alternatively, models can be used to suggest the spatial scale most appropriate for the species being assessed. Banks & Yasenak (10) used a correlated random-walk model fit to coccinellid beetle movement to determine the spatial scale at which these species perceive boundaries/edges of plots (estimated to be between 1 and 3 m for Coccinella septempunctata; 9). The mobility of the species is one factor that should be considered when deciding which plot size to implement. For highly mobile species, larger plot sizes are required to make robust inferences relating to treatment effects. Ohnesorg et al. (92) found no treatment effects when examining the impact of reduced-risk insecticides on the natural enemy community in soybean sampled with yellow sticky cards but did detect differences using sweep-net sampling and direct observations. The authors attributed the contradictory results to yellow sticky cards capturing highly mobile coccinellid beetles and to the small size of their plots (150 m2). When examining a community of species that vary in their level of mobility (or for which mobility is unknown), the plot size chosen will enable the researchers to detect the effect on only some of the species in the community. The researcher must ensure that the scope and intent of the study is clear and that the plot size is large enough to observe gross effects on target species. We have summarized the plot sizes used in 156 trials based on broad-acre crops published over the past 15 years (see Supplemental Table 1). These trials were mostly pesticide comparisons that used a small-plot design. We categorized the pest or natural enemy species into three mobility classes: low mobility (unwinged life stages, e.g., Lepidoptera larvae, Acari, Diptera larvae), medium mobility (capable of flight, e.g., Hemiptera, Thysanoptera), and high mobility (capable of long-distance flight, e.g., Aphididae, Lepidoptera adults, Coleoptera). When we examined the relationship between mean plot size and mobility score, we found that trials focused on species with lower mobility used smaller plot sizes than trials that focused on species with higher mobility (Figure 2). Overall, there was a large variation in plot sizes used across the crop types (Figure 2), with maize trials using the largest plot size. The plot size used for individual target species can vary considerably. In the broad-acre trials examined, the plot size for the southern green stink bug (Nezara viridula) in soybean ranged from 37 m2 to 124 m2 (threefold increase in plot size over 11 trials), and for the redbanded stink bug (Piezodorus guildinii) the plot size ranged from 37 m2 to 185 m2 (fivefold increase in plot size over 9 trials). HOW LONG FOR SHOULD I MONITOR AFTER APPLICATION? Top of page INTRODUCTION METHODS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IS MY PLOT SIZE LARGE ENOUGH? HOW LONG FOR SHOULD I MONITOR AFTER APPLICATION? TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments Monitoring of semifield studies usually includes a preapplication count and multiple postapplication assessments to quantify the duration of a pesticide\'s effects. Again there is no definitive answer as to how long the trial site should be monitored, because the duration of a pesticide\'s effects varies among target species, crops, sites, and applications. The duration of a pesticide\'s effects is the result of two processes operating simultaneously. First, the efficacy of the pesticide decreases across time, and this is unrelated to plot size. Second, the species recovers from pesticide application through population growth in the field or reinvasion from an external source area (34). Recovery rate is a function of the plot size (34), the distance to likely source areas (42, 65), the mobility of the species, and the numbers of individuals that survive the pesticide exposure (see “population survival index” in 28). Often we do not have all these pieces of information prior to a study commencing; however, there may be ways to estimate the recovery rate. Frampton (40) calculated that the nearest potential source for predators was 24 m from the study site. On the basis of the published recovery rates for carabid beetles (65) and linyphiid spiders (122), the authors concluded that recovery is not expected within 10 days after treatment (the length of the study). This rationale relies on knowledge of potential source areas in the landscape and ignores the issue of untreated plots acting as such. Longley et al. (79) used large (4 ha) unreplicated plots to examine the spatial changes in aphid and parasitoid populations following pesticide applications in wheat. These large plot sizes allowed the pattern of reinvasion from untreated areas to be monitored as it occurred over a longer period (101). Very few of the broad-acre trials summarized here (Figure 2) explicitly stated whether target species recovery was observed during the trial or even whether observing this process was within the initial scope of the trial. TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES Top of page INTRODUCTION METHODS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IS MY PLOT SIZE LARGE ENOUGH? HOW LONG FOR SHOULD I MONITOR AFTER APPLICATION? TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments Effect on Nontarget Species The effect of pesticide application on nontarget species is commonly used to quantify the unintended consequences on the environment and may provide insights that help mitigate negative impacts. Nontarget species fall into two main categories: (a) species that provide important ecosystem services such as honey bees (Apis mellifera) (27) and natural enemies of pest species (predatory or parasitic arthropods; 49, 88), and (b) species found within the same ecosystem that might act as surrogates for biodiversity more broadly (40, 69). The degree of acceptable losses associated with these two groups is different, as are the implications of risk assessments. A meta-analysis of experiments testing the impact of neonicotinoid insecticide on honey bees included four published semifield studies (23). Interestingly, only two of the four trials had enough statistical power to reasonably detect sublethal effects (should they occur) (23). Much larger sample sizes and methods that result in less variable data are required before conclusions can be drawn from these studies. An outdoor flight cage has been used to test the effects of insecticides on foraging activity and learning performance in honey bees (27). Stanley et al. (116) found that exposure to an insecticide increased the amount of time that foraging bees took to return to the hive, and fewer returned at all compared with a control. Semifield studies involving natural enemies of the target pest species are relatively common (e.g., 82, 92, 103). Many IPM programs rely on pesticides that are considered soft on natural enemies (7). Standard methods, including semifield methods, have been developed for determining the effects of pesticides on natural enemies (55). However, in the broad-acre trials summarized here (Figure 2), only 15% included natural enemies, and very few considered both pests and natural enemies simultaneously. Surrogate species are used by researchers when the species of interest is rare or endangered, and surrogates are expected to display a similar response to the perturbation being studied (8). At least two major problems are associated with using surrogate species to estimate the effects of pesticides. First, susceptibility to pesticides can vary greatly even among closely related species. Banks et al. (142) quantified the relative vulnerability of four parasitoid species to the sublethal effects of a toxicant and found that the extinction threshold varied widely among them. Second, differences in life-history strategies can result in differences in population demographics, which in turn result in some species being much more resilient to pesticides than others (119). Frampton (40) concluded that Collembola made poor bioindicator species because they were too spatially variable and showed relatively little response to the insecticide being studied. However, given the rate of biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes, the use of surrogate species and bioindicators may become a necessity in the future. Short-Term Versus Long-Term Effects The semifield methodology employed can fundamentally alter our ability to detect short-term versus long-term effects. Most studies do not state the temporal scale over which they are trying to assess impacts, yet some exceptions exist (25, 41, 134). Occasionally, this assessment is made retrospectively. For example, Frampton & van den Brink (43) concluded that 44 days after treatment was too short a time to determine the persistence of cypermethrin\'s indirect effects on a collembolan species. Langhof et al. (73) used excised plant material to examine the residual toxicity of an insecticide. Plants were taken from the field at different time intervals after application, with no toxic effects on parasitoids observed after 4 days. Using soil TME, Scholz-Starke et al. (111) found that the collembolan community had not fully recovered at the end of the study period, 340 days after treatment. Even if the recovery rate is slower than anticipated, a clear understanding of the power of a semifield design to detect effects across time can be beneficial. Nontarget arthropods in winter wheat recovered from insecticide application after about one year (134) in large 10-ha field plots. The Boxworth Project (51) is technically a field study, because it utilized large unreplicated blocks; however, owing to the long period over which invertebrate measurements were taken (1982–1990), long-term patterns in pesticide effects can be seen (also see 74, 129). Over the whole period, the number of predators found in the high-pesticide-input area was 53% lower than in the low-input areas (129). The authors concluded that the prophylactic approach favored highly dispersive species over resident predators and parasitoids with low powers of dispersal. Many of the observed changes would probably not have been identified if the researchers had used smaller plots (fields ranged in size from 5.7 to 17.3 ha; 51). Species-Specific Versus Community-Level Effects The impact of a pesticide on a population can include direct mortality (62), altered development (117) and behaviors (136), and reduced fecundity (36). Desneux et al. (28) reviewed sublethal effects, and Stark & Banks (117) reviewed the population-level effects of pesticides (assessed using mostly laboratory studies). Semifield studies have provided insights into behavioral studies that benefit from exposing the subject to its natural environment (see sidebar, Limitations of Laboratory Studies on the Effects of Pesticides). Wiles & Jepson (136) examined the within-crop behavior of the predatory coccinellid C. septempunctata in sprayed and unsprayed wheat field plots (30 m2). Exposure to pesticide residues affected beetle distribution down the crop canopy toward the ground. Beetles in the sprayed plot walked and groomed more frequently and rested less frequently than beetles in the unsprayed plot. Similarly, Banks & Stark (9) found that C. septempunctata in broccoli plots sprayed with imidacloprid and surrounded by bare ground dispersed farther and more directly than those in plots surrounded by weedy vegetation, highlighting the utility of conducting semifield studies in different landscape contexts. LIMITATIONS OF LABORATORY STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES Why are laboratory studies poor predictors of what is likely to occur in a commercial situation? ?1. Laboratory test populations have uniform development rates and physical characteristics. Also, they may not represent the genetic diversity of wild organisms owing to genetic bottlenecks that occur when rearing. ?2. Laboratory test subjects cannot avoid direct exposure to a pesticide. ?3. Laboratory test populations cannot move away from the area to avoid direct and indirect effects (repellency). ?4. Laboratory test subjects are in some way stressed prior to exposure due to being held in captivity and reared on artificial diets. ?5. In a commercial situation the dose of a pesticide is not uniform across space. Currently, no pesticides are truly species specific; therefore, studies that assess both direct and indirect effects of pesticides at the community level are required to fully understand the implications of widespread use of any pesticide. Semifield studies are useful in this context because they allow multiple species and interactions between species to be assessed simultaneously (Table 1). The choice of community-level endpoints is important and can include the number of species, abundance, dominance, species diversity, or some type of similarity index. Endlweber et al. (38) found that insecticides reduced overall collembolan abundance in set-aside arable field plots (9 m2) and reduced the dominance structure of the community, but surprisingly they had no effect on species composition. This result was attributed to recolonization of the relatively small treated plots soon after spraying. Frampton & van den Brink (43) found that collembolan responses to insecticides in wheat differed among species, and they used principal response curves (PRCs) to assess the effect on the entire community (consisting of 23 collembolan and 34 macroarthropod taxa). Volkmar et al. (131) found greater numbers of spider species in a split-field trial in which the pesticide dose was reduced by 50%. ASSESSING EFFECTS Top of page INTRODUCTION METHODS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IS MY PLOT SIZE LARGE ENOUGH? HOW LONG FOR SHOULD I MONITOR AFTER APPLICATION? TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments The analysis of semifield studies typically involves comparing target species counts postapplication with those in the control plots (usually unsprayed, or sprayed with water). Often the data are corrected for population growth over time using one of a range of formulas (1, 7, 59). Pretreatment sampling accounts for spatial variation in populations over short timescales. Of the broad-acre trials summarized here (Figure 2), 42% had a preapplication sample, and all had at least one or a time-series of samples postapplication. The lack of a preapplication sample in over half the studies limits our ability to conclusively link the observed effects only to the pesticide application in the short term. This control is especially valuable for large plots that may have high levels of within-plot variation in the abundance of target species. Over longer timescales other factors such as the dispersal ability of the species may be more important (43). The broad-acre trials (Figure 2) used on average four replicate plots per treatment level, and the degree of replication did not change in relation to plot size. A statistical power analysis by Prasifka et al. (100) showed that for herbivores sampled with yellow sticky cards, three to four replicates were enough to detect a 50% difference due to the treatment (with 70% probability). However, for beetles collected with pitfall traps, the number of replicates required increased to five or six. If the trials summarized (Figure 2) are indicative of the level of replication commonly used, many of these studies are only capable of detecting gross treatment effects. More modest impacts, if they do occur, go undetected. The statistical analysis of semifield studies has typically involved the use of conventional parametric univariate tests, such as analysis of variance (ANOVA), to assess the significance of treatment effects. Duan et al. (33) demonstrated that split-plot studies with repeated samples over two field seasons are capable of detecting a 50% difference in the abundance of the arthropod groups tested (statistical power of >80%). For some taxa, low counts and high variability in counts meant that the study design did not achieve the necessary power. Furthermore, Duan et al.\'s analysis was based on the quantification of the impact of a transgenic crop expressing an insecticide compared with the impact of a conventional crop. Treatments involving foliar applications of insecticides warrant their own statistical power analysis due to the difference in how species are exposed to toxicants. Multivariate techniques for assessing the community-level impact of pesticide applications are becoming more popular for semifield studies. PRCs (128), which have been used extensively in aquatic studies, are now being applied to semifield studies on terrestrial invertebrates (43, 49, 94, 95). For example, PRCs were used to assess the impact of insecticide treatments on the olive fruit fly (Bactrocera oleae) and nontarget arthropods found in an olive grove (49). The authors showed that despite the negative effect of the insecticide on natural enemies in general, the treatment did not disrupt control of the nontarget pest that was present, the olive psyllid (Euphyllura olivina). A comparison of different methods of data analysis found that the PRC analysis detected more treatment effects for less common predatory groups than the two-way ANOVA analysis did (94). COMMUNICATING EFFECTS Top of page INTRODUCTION METHODS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IS MY PLOT SIZE LARGE ENOUGH? HOW LONG FOR SHOULD I MONITOR AFTER APPLICATION? TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments Communicating the results found using semifield studies to growers and consultants usually takes the form of an impact table that qualitatively or quantitatively lists the relative effects of different pesticides on pests, natural enemies, and nontarget species (e.g., 139). The impact rating is usually grouped into categories based on a percentage reduction figure that can come from a range of sources. The IOBC (International Organisation for Biological and Integrated Control) classification scheme (55) uses four evaluation categories—harmless (<25% reduction), slightly harmful (25–50%), moderately harmful (51–75%), and harmful (>75%)—for assessing impact based on semifield trial results. Impact tables are increasingly being published in IPM guidelines and other extension material. However, data collected on the impact in one crop is often used to develop guidelines for different crops, and it is sometimes unclear how and when data from semifield studies are incorporated. Generally, it seems that laboratory studies provide the bulk of the data included in these tables, and there has been little discussion whether semifield data should be given more weight than laboratory studies (124) in the rare cases where both exist. The table from the IOBC Database on Selectivity of Pesticides (14) is the best example we can find that explicitly details when semifield data has been used to classify each pesticide. Similarly, researchers at Cornell University organized toxicological data on some common fruit and vegetable pesticides from a range of sources into a usable form by developing the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) (http://www.nysipm.cornell.edu/publications/EIQ/default.asp) (7). Each pesticide was rated from 1 (0% effect) to 5 (90–100% mortality) on the basis of information in a database (called SELECTV), and then multiplied by the pesticide half-life on plant surfaces times five to arrive at an impact rating. The larger the number is, the greater the likelihood of direct effects due to mortality of beneficial insects (5, 24). The EIQ was further developed into a Field Use Rating by multiplying it by the active ingredient and the field application rate. To test whether these impact ratings approximate what occurs in commercial situations, some researchers have summed the cumulative season-long pesticide inputs applied to a field and compared this to the relative abundance of pests and natural enemies (83, 90, 125). Regulatory bodies use labels on pesticide containers to inform farmers about potential health risks, potential risks to the environment, and appropriate application procedures (6). Labels that warn farmers about potential environmental impacts can be easily misinterpreted (107), and they currently provide limited information about the selectivity of a product. For example, Ajayi & Akinnifesi (3) interviewed farmers to gauge their understanding of the risks outlined on pesticide labels. Some farmers interpreted the information on the potential risk of pesticides on rivers and fishes to mean that they “should not go fishing after completing a pesticide field operation.” There are attempts to explore new ways of labeling products that include information on the compatibility of the chemical within IPM systems. Belgian authorities have gone one step further and proposed that chemical companies label whether a compound is harmless for a specific beneficial species (18). Making this statement is only possible if a harmless rating is reached in the successive levels of the tier-testing system developed by the IOBC Working Group (55), and this may require the use of semifield methods. Other agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are trying to identify and speed up the registration process for reduced-risk insecticides (http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/PR_Notices/pr97-3.html). These insecticides may reduce the risks to nontarget organisms and broaden the adoption of IPM strategies (92). Semifield studies may be especially useful for gathering data on comparative risk. ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE Top of page INTRODUCTION METHODS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IS MY PLOT SIZE LARGE ENOUGH? HOW LONG FOR SHOULD I MONITOR AFTER APPLICATION? TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments Despite their challenges and limitations, semifield studies are likely to be used in the future to assess a range of plant protection products because they are cost-effective and logistically tractable for most crops. These new products may differ from traditional pesticides that are sprayed onto the crop, and potentially include biopesticides (12, 123), food sprays (114), seed dressings (60), and transgenic crops (105) that express not only toxins but also semiochemicals (http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/Content.php?Section=AphidWheat). Improving the techniques used to conduct risk assessments on mobile invertebrates is crucial for ensuring we can confidently test these and other novel products in the future. Promising techniques that were relatively underutilized in the studies reviewed here include the use of cages or augmentative releases of pest species or natural enemy species, embedded in field-plot studies, to manipulate population density; alternate statistical techniques for assessing effects at the species and community levels; molecular techniques to understand the effect of pesticides on important species interactions; and modeling to assess direct impacts and recovery rates (120). Topping & Lagisz (127) used an agent-based model to explore the spatial factors influencing the effect of insecticides on a hypothetical predatory beetle (based on Bembidion lampros). They demonstrated that the recovery time for this species changed from 3.1 to 11.5 years if the area to which the insecticides were applied increased from 10% to 50%. This strategy could be taken one step further to model the impact of pesticide application on tritrophic dynamics and species interactions in the field (53). In another example, Banks & Stark (9) sprayed C. septempunctata with a pesticide, measured its movement, and then compared the empirical results with those from a correlated random-walk model. Using a theoretical model, Martini et al. (84) showed that pesticide performance was positively correlated with pest mobility; however, if the pesticide is repellent, the probability of exposure decreases. CONCLUSIONS Top of page INTRODUCTION METHODS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IS MY PLOT SIZE LARGE ENOUGH? HOW LONG FOR SHOULD I MONITOR AFTER APPLICATION? TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments Given the widespread nature of pesticide use in many agricultural landscapes, assessing the effect of pesticides on target and nontarget species is important (97). These studies are critical to improving the sustainability of today\'s farming systems and mitigating environmental degradation in the future. Very few aspects of this risk can be assessed in the laboratory (see sidebar, Limitations of Laboratory Studies on the Effects of Pesticides), and therefore semifield studies are essential. Furthermore, the results of these studies can be used to bring about changes in pesticide use and support the development of true IPM (35, 141). Even relatively small changes in pesticide-use patterns (e.g., the switch from a broad-spectrum to a selective chemical; 45) might have significant environmental (99) and management benefits (46, 47). In a regulatory context, the decision to limit the use of a chemical must be made once the risks associated with that chemical in a commercial production landscape are evaluated. The evidence base for pest management decision making is currently fairly scant in both a regulatory context and as part of IPM programs. Semifield methods can and are being used to assess the effects of pesticides on mobile invertebrates. Researchers must ensure that the scope and intent of each trial is well understood and articulated. For most of the studies reviewed here, there was limited evaluation of the mobility of the target species; however, studies on species with higher mobilities do in general use larger plot sizes (Figure 2). Despite this, we suspect few semifield studies have the power necessary to detect sublethal or indirect effects on target species due to low levels of replication in systems with high inherent variability. All the semifield methods we have included in this review are not new, and some have been used successfully for many years. The novelty is introduced when we start to utilize these techniques in new contexts, combine them with other experimental/observational strategies (e.g., modeling, landscape ecology, food webs), and synthesize results across multiple trials. We encourage researchers to consider how they could use semifield methods to incorporate pesticide-effect assessments into studies on land-use change, climate change, invasive species, or productivity.

TARGET SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ASSESSING EFFECTS COMMUNICATING EFFECTS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES ON MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN THE FUTURE CONCLUSIONS FUTURE ISSUES disclosure statement acknowledgments 1. An easily accessible species trait database that includes factors such as susceptibility and recovery rate (both based on laboratory studies) as well as mobility across a range of pest and natural enemy species may improve our ability to design semifield studies in the future. 2. The use of semifield studies to predict likely impact in a commercial situation will require more explicit incorporation of both direct and indirect effects into the scope of trials. 3. Few semifield studies achieve the temporal resolution necessary to capture long-term effects. However, examples of longer-term farming systems studies could be used to capture effects at these longer timescales. 4. Agriculture is a global industry. However, not all countries have equal research capability and access to information. Ideally, all products would be tested locally using semifield studies. In situations where this is impractical, a minimum requirement would be that trials conducted in a similar context in another country should be accessible. Ensuring that publicly funded trial data are freely accessible over the Internet would facilitate data sharing. Furthermore, such data aggregations can be used to search for effect patterns consistent across multiple agricultural systems or species (106). 5. Finally, we need to develop ways to better integrate semifield studies into impact tables to be communicated to farmers. Development of impact tables and pesticide labels, in consultation with the target audience, is crucial to getting the information to the people who need it. disclosure statement Top of page INTRODUCTION METHODS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS IS MY PLOT SIZE LARGE ENOUGH?

The Kenyan government has given permission to an energy company to explore for oil & gas in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, the main site where we have been working the past several years (and just 2km away from where we are doing fieldwork this week). This exploration will entail cutting large (4m-wide) swaths through the three different forest habitat types (Brachystegia woodland, Cynometra thicket, and Mixed forest) in order to sink drills deep into the ground - potentially disastrous for the resident wildlife, not to mention the integrity of the forest reserve. A Chinese company that has been subcontracted to conduct the exploratory drilling has decamped to a (former) corn field just adjacent to our restoration forest plots in Gede. The local newspapers summarized the situation in a a story they ran late in the week.  View of BGP staging area for oil/gas exploration from our study site This type of threat to the preservation of forest habitat and rare animals is, sadly, not uncommon - witness the ongoing challenges to conservation and indigenous rights faced in the Yasuni National Park in Ecuador. Arabuko-Sokoke Forest (ASF) is home to a critical mass of endangered/threatened birds and mammals, and, as the last remaining big patch of coastal forest in East Africa, is extremely critical to numerous conservation efforts. For the past five years I\'ve been working with a local NGO that has amassed a ton of data on many of the endangered species in the forest; together we\'ve worked to collect more data and publish scientific papers that try to describe the habitat needs of threatened bird species as well as the complexities of managing for a disparate array of wildlife  (including a herd of African elephants) in the confined space of a small forest reserve, among other things. But arguably a much bigger threat to conservation is the fact that ASF is also ringed by 50+ villages of Giriama (one of the nine coastal ethnic groups that comprise the Mijikenda) residents - with a total population of 100,000 or so local residents who have historically relied to varying degrees on forest products (bushmeat, wood for charcoal production & fuelwood, etc.). Reducing some of the pressure on the forest associated with such intense anthropogenic disturbances is key to conserving the Arabuko habitat and the species within, of course. And, as elsewhere in tropical biodiversity hotspots, there have been some well-meaning and effective programs established over the years aimed at providing alternative incoming generating activities for locals, including butterfly rearing and bee-keeping programs as well as a terrific environmental education scheme. But these can seem woefully inadequate in scale when put in a geopolitical context.       Of course, apart from the poaching concerns, there is also the ever-present issue of security in this country - as I write this, rioting youth have blocked the streets with coral and burning tires in nearby Timboni village in protest over the inaction of police in response to a killing in the streets of Watamu Saturday night. The ongoing battle with Al-Shabab in neighboring Somalia (a conflict which just marked its fourth year anniversary) and its attendant unrest also continues to threaten stability throughout the country. This ultimately leads to heightened threats to the environment: as tourism has plummeted due to security concerns, many people have been reduced to relying on dwindling forest and marine resources for survival. The challenge for conservation science is incorporating all of these issues into cogent, practical, and effective solutions. A scientific approach to the underlying ecological issues is of course absolutely essential -- as is a fierce and passionate dedication to the conservation of biodiversity. At the same time, conservation strategies that willfully ignore the basic needs and misunderstand the culture of local people will never be effective or sustainable. Working together with local communities to solve social, economic, and environmental challenges will be the key here. Several recent articles circulating in the scientific community have argued eloquently for a more holistic, inclusive approach to conservation science - a call that extends to working to ensure an increased diversity of perspectives within the scientific community as well. This approach would be well-suited to situations such as the ones facing many communities here in coastal Kenya.      In the meantime, here on the ground in Kilifi District, a number of local community groups along with concerned NGOs presented the governor with a petition protesting the oil & gas exploration plan a few days ago. Let\'s hope this diverse array of voices will be heard, and more rationale attitudes prevail -- we already face enough challenges!   Posted by Buck at 6:31 AM No comments: Saturday, November 8, 2014 Gede fieldwork underway! Sampling arthropod biodiversity with Kirao and Arnold in Gede restoration forest With the help of intrepid field assistants Kirao and Arnold (local residents with the intern/volunteer program at A Rocha Kenya), we have been getting it done in the restoration forest at Gede Ruins. Each morning we\'ve been putting out pitfall traps full of soapy water to capture  ground-dwelling arthropods (spiders and beetles), and malaise traps designed to capture flying insects (wasps/bees, beetles, flies). I have brought two kinds of malaise traps (visible in above picture) with me for this expedition -- a large white trap that is anchored on the ground and captures insects flying up to a meter or so off the ground, and another smaller gray trap that can be hung from trees used to capture insects flying around two meters above the ground. Each of these traps has a collecting chamber at the top of the netting material; insects flying into the netting make their way upwards (towards the light) and fly into the chamber, falling into alcohol with which we have charged the trap. We also put out yellow bowls full of soapy water, which attracts wasps and bees. Each morning we collect the specimens from all of the traps, and bring them back here to the Mwamba Field Centre , where we transfer them to vials containing 70% alcohol sorted by type (Order) of insect. I will deliver the specimens to a colleague at the National Museums of Kenya in Nairobi before flying back to the U.S. next week. Kirao and Arnold placing scarab (dung) beetles into vials. For this expedition, we are exploring the effects that the presence of Neem (Azadirachta indica) trees may have on arthropod communities. Neem has insecticidal properties -- the seeds are used to make biorational pesticides -- so it\'s possible that the mere presence of the tree may deter insects from lingering in plots with high concentrations of Neem. Our traps are designed to measure activity of insects/arthropods in the plots -- because they are \"passive traps\", they don\'t measure overall abundance -- so they are well-suited to comparing activity among plots with different concentrations of Neem. Our preliminary results from our last sampling expedition indicate that there may be a pattern, so we\'re checking to see if any sort of pattern emerges from a larger number of replicated plots. Neem tree in Gede Ruins   Posted by Buck at 11:12 PM No comments: Thursday, November 6, 2014 Hurry up and wait! or, How I learned to stop worrying and love the journey ??  On the tarmac in Nairobi ?? Patience... Day three here on the Kenyan coast, and we have finally placed our first arthropod traps in the nearby Gede restoration forest. Yesterday was a day spent wrangling with various bureaucratic headaches - replete with frantic phone calls/texts to colleagues back at the Nairobi headquarters of the National Museums of Kenya - the organization that oversees operations of the Gede National Monument here on the coast where we\'re working. As is often the case here, our dialogue was full of nuance and intimation - eventually it became clear that a sticking point was my lapsed membership as an Affiliate Member of the National Museums of Kenya. By the end of the day we had resolved that upon my renewal (and accompanying fee payment), we would be allowed access into the forest to do our research. Thus ensued a frantic afternoon rushing into town to take care of transferring money via M-pesa, a cell phone-based service for which Kenya is quite well known (The Economist has highlighted this service several times recently, praising it\'s simplicity and practicality). Once we were able to load the money onto our phone, we then simply sent it to our colleague\'s phone in Nairobi, and we were all set. M-pesa station, Watamu This morning, as promised, we were allowed access to the forest (after another hourlong delay - but who\'s counting?) - finally putting in traps to capture ground-dwelling and flying insects in the restoration forest. We\'re looking forward to returning in the morning to see what we\'ve caught!

Continuing a collaboration with David Macfarlane of Michigan State University and Colin Jackson of A Rocha Kenya, I\'m here collecting arthropod diversity data in plots within a forest that was restored with native tree species over twenty years ago. I\'m focusing this time on plots that contain volunteer Neem trees --- an exotic species from India that has been proposed as a species suitable for timber production in Kenya plantations. Data collected at the site last year suggest that higher percentages of above ground carbon comprised of Neem is correlated with higher ratios of flying to ground-dwelling arthropods. Over the next ten days we\'ll be collecting more data to see whether or not this pattern holds up with more replication. if it does, it could have important implications for how we view the presence of introduced species in restoration areas.

Larsson Guest Researcher program. Over the next three years I\'ll be working with the Ecosystem Services and Conservation Research Team on several projects, some short-term, some longer-term. Thematically, these projects are all (more or less) aimed at better understanding the factors that govern the population dynamics of insects important in agricultural production. Topics include modeling the effects of pesticides on bumble bee populations, exploring how parasitoid wasps (important for biological control of insect pests) respond to habitat fragmentation, and (along with colleagues at CSIRO Australia and the University of California) exploring the effects of vegetation diversity on pests and beneficial insects in agroecosystems.

Fishing in the bay, Cotonou Bonjour! Just wrapped up an exploratory expedition to the West African nations of Benin & Togo, where I have been laying the groundwork for both research and study abroad opportunities with local contacts along with colleagues from Michigan State University. We spent much of our time with local voodoo practitioners learning about the sacred forests spread throughout this part of the world, with a focus on the interactions among their spiritual practices, stewardship of the sacred forests, and the biological diversity within and around the forests. My colleagues and I are especially interested in exploring the social and scientific issues that form the backdrop for these interactions. For my part, I\'m interested in how arthropod diversity both within and around sacred forests may play a role in both the spiritual and the scientific (conservation) aspects of this interplay. For instance, forest stewardship may bolster ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control in nearby agricultural fields. I\'m looking forward to setting up some experiments with colleagues at the university in Abomey-Calavi (Cotonou) to test some hypotheses related to these and other interchanges - as well as creating opportunities for UW Tacoma students to explore the myriad rich cultural and scientific aspects of life and conservation in West Africa.

Market in Ouidah Posted by Buck at 1:49 AM No comments: Tuesday, August 13, 2013 Human-forest mutualisms in Kenya Preparing to enter kaya Kinondo I have just wrapped up a  two-week expedition in coastal Kenya, where, along with colleagues from Michigan State University, I\'ve been helping lay the groundwork for research that explores the mutualistic relationship between coastal forests and nearby local villagers. Working with local collaborators that include the National Museums of Kenya, A Rocha Kenya, and the Kenya Forestry Research Institute, we have been meeting with members of local Community Forest Associations around Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, Dakatcha Woodlands, Shimba Hills, and a few sacred forests (\"kayas\") around Mombasa and the South Coast. Many of these villagers (which consist of members of several of the nine tribes that constitute the Mijikenda coastal tribes, who originated from Somalia) rely on forest products such as cut stems/poles for fuelwood, charcoal production, and wood carving - all responsible for negative effects on forest ecosystems that are well-documented in this part of the world. At the same time, many villagers living adjacent to forests also contribute positive benefits to forest ecosystems, including such activities as planting native tree and plant species and beekeeping. Our interest is in documenting such human-forest mutualisms, comparing them with biodiversity metrics in a range of habitats subject to different governance systems. Furthermore, we hope to engage local residents in participatory planning processes to positively increase the scope and impact of these human-forest mutualisms. ?

How is this different than the current \"Tracks\"? The main difference is that the option will show up on your transcript, while the tracks do not. Even more reason to meet with Arlyn or your faculty advisor to see if an option is right for you! The Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science provides students with a strong science background focused on the environmental issues of the future. Through lecture, lab and field classes, you will get hands-on experience with biology, chemistry, the geosciences, physics and math. This course of study teaches you how to draw connections between these disciplines in order to solve the complex, interdisciplinary environmental problems facing the local community and society at large. Read more about Environmental Studies (Bachelor of Arts) The Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies offers students a strong background in environmental science, complemented by a range of non-science courses. Starting with a core of courses in the earth and life sciences, it branches out to examine legal, economic, literary, historical and philosophical perspectives on the environment. The focus is inherently interdisciplinary and addresses both global and local issues. Collectively, environmental studies courses explore how scientific information gets translated by political and cultural arenas into social, ethical, legal and technological responses to environmental problems.

The August Teodor Larsson Foundation was founded on 14 January 1956 \"for lasting promotion of scientific research in the field of agriculture\". In 2004 the Faculty of Natural Resources and Agricultural Sciences was given the right to receive the annual income from the Foundation, and on 13 April 2011 decided to establish a national and international researcher exchange programme. The purpose of the August T. Larsson Foundation Guest Researcher initiative is to engage guest researchers within strategically important and prioritised fields at the Faculty. The aim of the program is not only to strengthen research, education and/or environmental monitoring and assessment but also to expand the university\'s interface with other research environments. The programme enables guest researchers to spend short periods at the faculty (one month per term) over a period of three years. Guest researchers will receive funding to cover their salary, travel expenses and accommodations, as well as for journeys between SLU\'s regional centres and for a fellow member of their team to visit SLU (\"tag-along\"). For specific information about the programme, see the Staff web.

I use a combination of field experiments and mathematical models to explore how  increased vegetation diversity (e.g., intercropping/trap-cropping) and other interventions may be deployed across spatial scales to manage crop pest populations. I am also interested in the compatibility of biological control and pesticide use (see Ecotoxicology research below). My fieldwork approaches include working with farmers to explore sustainability in commercial crop systems, as well as conducting manipulative field experiments. Furthermore, I explore population dynamics and herbivore/natural enemy movement behavior using models parameterized with life history traits and dispersal measurements. I recently began collaborating on projects addressing these and other issues with colleagues from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences as part of their Ecosystem Services & Conservation Research team.

[DOI link to article]       Ecotoxicology/ Risk assessment/ Population dynamics modeling      Back to top The effects of toxicants such as pesticides on both target and non-target organisms have historically been studied with little consideration of ecological factors such as population age-structure and sublethal effects.  Together with Dr. John Stark, an environmental  toxicologist from Washington State University (where I am also an Adjunct Faculty member in the Department of Entomology), I have been working on evaluating methodologies used in toxicological risk assessment. In particular, we have been examining the merits of considering  population-level endpoints  (as opposed to more traditional approaches such as use of the LC50) in determining the effects of pesticides and other contaminants on biological populations and communities.  In addition to conducting lab and field experiments, we have an ongoing collaboration with mathematicians from North Carolina State University, exploring the use of different mathematical models to  describe population dynamics in risk assessment data. More generally, I am interested in how factors such as competition and disturbance interact with life history traits to affect population dynamics for a variety of organisms, with a focus on applications to agriculture and conservation. Most recently, I have been working with colleagues at Washington State University and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette to better understand how the use of common species as surrogates in risk assessment may mislead us in our efforts to protect beneficial or rare/endangered species in both natural and managed systems.

As part of this effort, we have been comparing arthropod biodiversity across a wide range of coffee grower practices and landscape characteristics. Most recently we have been focusing on the role that forest fragments have on pollinator populations and coffee yields, working in the spring and summer with groups of Earthwatch volunteers to collect data. Birds, arthropods, and elephants The past few years I have been exploring the link between a suite of endangered bird species (most of which are insectivorous) and their arthropod prey in East Africa. My first project concerned the distribution of a Threatened thrush, the East Coast Akalat (Sheppardia gunningi), and its prey in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest in coastal Kenya.  Working with Colin Jackson, a local ornithologist at the Mwamba Field Study Centre and Bird Observatory in Watamu, UWT undergraduates, and colleagues from ICIPE and NMK, we have been comparing spatial distributions of the insectivorous Akalat with arthropod diversity in different habitat types within Arabuko-Sokoke; furthermore, I\'m interested in how disturbance caused by African elephants (Loxodonta africana) within a managed reserve may influence distributions and abundance of both birds and arthropods.  See recent article on this project in UW Columns magazine here. More recently, I have been involved in a collaboration with Colin Jackson and David MacFarlane (Michigan State University) assessing the recovery of a restoration project in Gede Ruins National Monument. This forest was planted with native trees some twenty years ago, and now we are looking at how plant, arthropod, and bird populations have recovered relative to nearby reference sites - and how different planting techniques (e.g., direct seeding, natural regeneration, etc.) have fared. Farmland, forests, & biodiversity How much do agricultural areas contribute to biodiversity conservation in the tropics? Together with UW students from the Seattle and Tacoma campuses, I have been sampling arthropod diversity on farmland and adjacent tropical forest fragments in the rural farming village of Mastatal, near Santiago de Puriscal, Costa Rica, a few hours west and south of San Jose.  I\'m particularly interested in how farm and near-farm habitats may affect insect diversity in ways that may benefit both farms and conservation. Furthermore,  we have also conducted some samples in nearby La Cangreja National Park, (established in 2002). By comparing arthropod diversity among these different habitats, we hope to better understand the role different habitats in landscapes traditionally regarded as \"marginal\" (such as agroecosystems) may play in terms of both production and conservation. Some of our data from Mastatal was recently incorporated into a large international database project (PREDICTS) linking biodiversity with anthropogenic disturbance. Selected Publications: Hudson, L.

Data drive business decisions. Telecommunication companies rely on organized data to offer continuous improvement in cell coverage, optimally route calls, and provide responsive and personal customer care services. Companies that succeed in turning data into information and products can gain important business advantage in an intensely competitive industry. Hadoop is a promising infrastructure for data-intensive distributed analytics using inexpensive commodity hardware. However, its focus is on scalable processing of large amounts of input data with shallow analytics, and it ignores resource data requirements for deep analytics. Many large-scale data analytic tasks depend on massive amounts of analytic resource data (for example, statistical models), and it is difficult to co-locate or migrate them. This project focuses on problems related to challenges in using Hadoop over data generated in the telecommunications industry. In particular, we look at how existing data models, storage techniques, access methods can be adapted to work with Hadoop and how to leverage these adaptations for performing analysis. Researchers: Ullas Nambiar, Himanshu Gupta, Tanveer Faruquie and Mukesh Mohania CRM Framework for Business Analytics Predictive analytics (i.e., propensity to buy and churn) forms a cornerstone of the customer care and insight strategy. Delivering predictive analytics in a scalable fashion requires software tooling to minimize reliance on scarce highly-skilled resources. Tooling is also needed to reduce the time and effort required to access, extract, and transform data as input to predictive analyses. In this project, we aim to enhance the customer relationship management (CRM) framework for predictive analytics by leveraging the Cognos Adaptive Analytics Framework and the InfoSphere Design Studio to assist in mapping customer databases to IFW Industry Models. Researchers: Prasad Deshpande, Sumit Negi, Ramakrishnan Kannan, Anup K Chalamala, Soujanya Soni, Bipen K Telkar Efficient Processing of Large XML Data The use of large XML documents, exceeding 1 GB, is on the rise. Existing software are not capable of handling such large XML documents in an efficient manner. The project aims to design techniques for efficient processing of large XML documents in parallel on multiple machines. Researchers: Manish Bhide, Manoj Agarwal, Srinivas Kiran Mittapalli System T Enhancements System T is a framework for rule-based information extraction in which the rules are expressed declaratively using a SQL like language called AQL. In this project, we aim to enhance System T functionality by adding new features to AQL such as UDF support, recursion, among others.

Apply to MSL New Student Application 2013 Returning Student Early Application Mission The mission of The MSL Program is to encourage, motivate, and inspire students to succeed in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and develop the leadership and academic skills necessary to pursue a career in STEM fields. Program overview Since 2003, the Math-Science-Leadership Program (MSL) has been creating positive educational experiences that enhance academic success and access to career pathways in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). MSL serves youth in grades 7-12 that are historically underrepresented in STEM (low-income, minority, female and potential first-generation college students). MSL brings together youth with students and faculty from UW Tacoma for an engaging three-week summer program and community-building monthly events throughout the school year. MSL develops supportive cohorts that build positive science-linked identities, academic and leadership skills over six years and creates capacity for community-serving institutions to collaboratively build increase youths’ ability to participate in the economies of the future.

Recent Events Please join us in congratulating Yiru Li, Sarah George, Craig Apfelbeck, Abdeltawab Hendawi, David Hazel, Ankur Teredesai and Mohamed Ali on winning the \"Best Demo\" award at the ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS Conference 2014  on the iTornado system. The paper is titled: “Routing Service With Real World Severe Weather” and presents a framework for routing services to evacuate vehicles under real world severe weather threats. The system is able to: (1) Identify the users inside the dangerous region of a severe weather event, (2) Recommend an evacuation route to guide the users out to a safe destination or shelter, (3) Assure the recommended route to be one of the shortest paths after excluding the risky area, and  (4) Maintain the flow of traffic by normalizing the evacuation on the possible safe routes. For additional information, please visit the Geospatial Data Management page of the Center for Data Science: http://cwds.uw.edu/geospatial-data-management” Dr. George Mobus, Associate Professor in Computer Science & Systems and Computer Engineering & Systems, has just had his textbook (along with co-author Professor Emeritus Michael Kalton of IAS) entitled Principles of Systems Science published by Springer, New York. This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. The book contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. Please join us in congratulating Dr. Mobus on this major accomplishment. For more information go to: Springer\'s Website: http://www.springer.com/physics/complexity/book/978-1-4939-1919-2 UPCOMING EVENTS End of Quarter Colloquium, Autumn 2014 December 5, 2014 Location: BHS 104 & BHS 106 Time: 9 am - 3:30 pm Please come and join the Institute of Technology in their end of the quarter colloquium.

We consider the problem of suggesting a personalized itinerary to a user in an interactive manner. The iterative process works as follows: (1) the user provides feedback on POIs selected by the system, (2) the system recommends the best itineraries based on all feedback so far, and (3) the system further selects a new set of POIs, with optimal utility, to solicit feedback for, at the next step. This iterative process stops when the user is satisfied with the recommended itinerary.

In this journal, we explore the impact of space constraints on maintaining per-user and pairwise item lists and develop two complementary solutions that leverage shared user behavior to maintain the efficiency of our group recommendation algorithms within a space budget. The ?rst solution, behavior factoring, factors out user agreements from disagreement lists, while the second solution, partial materialization, selectively materializes a subset of disagreement lists.

Facetedpedia is a faceted search system that dynamically discovers query-dependent faceted interfaces for Wikipedia search result articles. Senjuti Basu Roy, Sihem Amer-Yahia, Ashish Chawla, Gautam Das and Cong Yu. “Constructing and Exploring Composite Items”. Accepted in SIGMOD 2010. We investigate how to assist user in online shopping by suggesting packages to her with the item she is primarily interested to purchase (central item) (e.g., the accessories of iPhone as a package during iPhone purchase). In particular, we propose to build composite items which associates a central item with a set of packages, formed by satellite items, and help users explore them. We define and study the problem of effective construction and exploration of large sets of packages associated with the central item, and design and implement efficient algorithms for solving the problem in two stages: summarization, and visual effect optimization. Ning Yan, Chengkai Li, Senjuti Basu Roy, Lekhendro Lisham and Gautam Das. “Facetedpedia: Dynamic Generation of Query-Dependent Faceted Interfaces for Wikipedia”. Accepted in WWW 2010. Wikipedia has become the largest encyclopedia ever created, with close to 3 million English articles by far. We propose FacetedPedia, a faceted retrieval system for information discovery and exploration over Wikipedia. Given the set of articles resulting from a keyword search query, FacetedPedia dynamically and automatically discovers a faceted interface for navigating and exploring the result articles. Sihem Amer-Yahia, Senjuti Basu Roy, Ashish Chawla, Gautam Das and Cong Yu. “Group Recommendation: Semantics and Efficiency”. VLDB 2009. The need for group recommendation arises in many scenarios: a movie for friends to watch together, a travel destination for a family to spend a holiday break, and so on. We consider the problem of group recommendation where each group is formed by a set of users. The central idea is to aim at returning items which are more likely to be liked by each member in the group. We investigate several properties critical to group recommendation, and design efficient algortihms. Senjuti Basu Roy, Haidong Wang, Ullas Nambiar, Gautam Das and Mukesh Mohania. “DynaCet: Building Dynamic Faceted Search Systems over Databases”. Demo paper, ICDE 2009. In this demo, we present DynaCet - a domain independent system that provides effective minimum-effort based dynamic faceted search solutions over enterprise databases. At every step, Dynacet suggests facets depending on the user response at previous step. Facets are selected based on their ability to rapidly drill down to the most promising tuples, as well as on the ability of the user to provide desired values for them. The benefits provided include faster access to information stored in databases while taking into consideration the variance in user knowledge and preferences. Senjuti Basu Roy and Gautam Das “Top-k Implementation Techniques of Minimum Effort Driven Faceted Search For Databases”. Accepted in COMAD 2009. We investigate opportunities to improve the performance of minimum effort driven Faceted search techniques. The main idea is motivated by the early stopping techniques used in the TA-family of algorithms for top-k computations. Senjuti Basu Roy, Haidong Wang, Gautam Das, Ullas Nambiar and Mukesh Mohania “Minimum-Effort Driven Dynamic Faceted Search in Structured Databases”. In Proc. CIKM 2008: 13-22. We investigate how Faceted Search can be enabled over structured databases for tuple search. Our Facet Selection techniques rely on selecting facets dynamically based on user response using minimum effort based techniques in principle. Senjuti Basu Roy, Gautam Das and Sajal K.

Senjuti Basu Roy, Kausik Kayal and Jaya Sil. “Edge Preserving Image Compression Technique using Adaptive Feed Forward Neural Network.” EuroIMSA 2005: 467-471. The aim of this work is to develop an edge preserving image compression technique using one hidden layer feed forward neural network of which the neurons are determined adaptively. The network is trained using the single processed image block. The work proposes initialization of weights between the input and lone hidden layer by transforming pixel coordinates of the input pattern block into its equivalent one-dimensional representation.Our research Connections Careers About us Microsoft Translator | All Downloads Events Groups News People Projects Publications Videos Data Management, Exploration and Mining (DMX) Overview The Data Platforms and Analytics pillar currently consists of the Data Management, Mining and Exploration Group (DMX) group, which focuses on solving key problems in information management.

Data drive business decisions. Telecommunication companies rely on organized data to offer continuous improvement in cell coverage, optimally route calls, and provide responsive and personal customer care services. Companies that succeed in turning data into information and products can gain important business advantage in an intensely competitive industry. Hadoop is a promising infrastructure for data-intensive distributed analytics using inexpensive commodity hardware. However, its focus is on scalable processing of large amounts of input data with shallow analytics, and it ignores resource data requirements for deep analytics. Many large-scale data analytic tasks depend on massive amounts of analytic resource data (for example, statistical models), and it is difficult to co-locate or migrate them. This project focuses on problems related to challenges in using Hadoop over data generated in the telecommunications industry. In particular, we look at how existing data models, storage techniques, access methods can be adapted to work with Hadoop and how to leverage these adaptations for performing analysis. Researchers: Ullas Nambiar, Himanshu Gupta, Tanveer Faruquie and Mukesh Mohania CRM Framework for Business Analytics Predictive analytics (i.e., propensity to buy and churn) forms a cornerstone of the customer care and insight strategy. Delivering predictive analytics in a scalable fashion requires software tooling to minimize reliance on scarce highly-skilled resources. Tooling is also needed to reduce the time and effort required to access, extract, and transform data as input to predictive analyses. In this project, we aim to enhance the customer relationship management (CRM) framework for predictive analytics by leveraging the Cognos Adaptive Analytics Framework and the InfoSphere Design Studio to assist in mapping customer databases to IFW Industry Models. Researchers: Prasad Deshpande, Sumit Negi, Ramakrishnan Kannan, Anup K Chalamala, Soujanya Soni, Bipen K Telkar Efficient Processing of Large XML Data The use of large XML documents, exceeding 1 GB, is on the rise. Existing software are not capable of handling such large XML documents in an efficient manner. The project aims to design techniques for efficient processing of large XML documents in parallel on multiple machines. Researchers: Manish Bhide, Manoj Agarwal, Srinivas Kiran Mittapalli System T Enhancements System T is a framework for rule-based information extraction in which the rules are expressed declaratively using a SQL like language called AQL. In this project, we aim to enhance System T functionality by adding new features to AQL such as UDF support, recursion, among others.

Apply to MSL New Student Application 2013 Returning Student Early Application Mission The mission of The MSL Program is to encourage, motivate, and inspire students to succeed in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and develop the leadership and academic skills necessary to pursue a career in STEM fields. Program overview Since 2003, the Math-Science-Leadership Program (MSL) has been creating positive educational experiences that enhance academic success and access to career pathways in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). MSL serves youth in grades 7-12 that are historically underrepresented in STEM (low-income, minority, female and potential first-generation college students). MSL brings together youth with students and faculty from UW Tacoma for an engaging three-week summer program and community-building monthly events throughout the school year. MSL develops supportive cohorts that build positive science-linked identities, academic and leadership skills over six years and creates capacity for community-serving institutions to collaboratively build increase youths’ ability to participate in the economies of the future. By bringing together the ideas and needs of community groups that serve K-12 youth, post secondary institutions of learning and industry, MSL fosters these long-term impacts: Reducing achievement gaps for students in science and mathematics compared to peers who have not participated in MSL; Increasing diversity of students who enroll in and complete STEM college degrees; Increase Tacoma community engagement in K-12 STEM informal education efforts.

Recent Events Please join us in congratulating Yiru Li, Sarah George, Craig Apfelbeck, Abdeltawab Hendawi, David Hazel, Ankur Teredesai and Mohamed Ali on winning the \"Best Demo\" award at the ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS Conference 2014  on the iTornado system. The paper is titled: “Routing Service With Real World Severe Weather” and presents a framework for routing services to evacuate vehicles under real world severe weather threats. The system is able to: (1) Identify the users inside the dangerous region of a severe weather event, (2) Recommend an evacuation route to guide the users out to a safe destination or shelter, (3) Assure the recommended route to be one of the shortest paths after excluding the risky area, and  (4) Maintain the flow of traffic by normalizing the evacuation on the possible safe routes. For additional information, please visit the Geospatial Data Management page of the Center for Data Science: http://cwds.uw.edu/geospatial-data-management” Dr. George Mobus, Associate Professor in Computer Science & Systems and Computer Engineering & Systems, has just had his textbook (along with co-author Professor Emeritus Michael Kalton of IAS) entitled Principles of Systems Science published by Springer, New York. This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. The book contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. Please join us in congratulating Dr. Mobus on this major accomplishment.

We consider the problem of suggesting a personalized itinerary to a user in an interactive manner. The iterative process works as follows: (1) the user provides feedback on POIs selected by the system, (2) the system recommends the best itineraries based on all feedback so far, and (3) the system further selects a new set of POIs, with optimal utility, to solicit feedback for, at the next step. This iterative process stops when the user is satisfied with the recommended itinerary.

In this journal, we explore the impact of space constraints on maintaining per-user and pairwise item lists and develop two complementary solutions that leverage shared user behavior to maintain the efficiency of our group recommendation algorithms within a space budget. The ?rst solution, behavior factoring, factors out user agreements from disagreement lists, while the second solution, partial materialization, selectively materializes a subset of disagreement lists.

Facetedpedia is a faceted search system that dynamically discovers query-dependent faceted interfaces for Wikipedia search result articles. Senjuti Basu Roy, Sihem Amer-Yahia, Ashish Chawla, Gautam Das and Cong Yu. “Constructing and Exploring Composite Items”. Accepted in SIGMOD 2010. We investigate how to assist user in online shopping by suggesting packages to her with the item she is primarily interested to purchase (central item) (e.g., the accessories of iPhone as a package during iPhone purchase). In particular, we propose to build composite items which associates a central item with a set of packages, formed by satellite items, and help users explore them. We define and study the problem of effective construction and exploration of large sets of packages associated with the central item, and design and implement efficient algorithms for solving the problem in two stages: summarization, and visual effect optimization. Ning Yan, Chengkai Li, Senjuti Basu Roy, Lekhendro Lisham and Gautam Das. “Facetedpedia: Dynamic Generation of Query-Dependent Faceted Interfaces for Wikipedia”. Accepted in WWW 2010. Wikipedia has become the largest encyclopedia ever created, with close to 3 million English articles by far. We propose FacetedPedia, a faceted retrieval system for information discovery and exploration over Wikipedia. Given the set of articles resulting from a keyword search query, FacetedPedia dynamically and automatically discovers a faceted interface for navigating and exploring the result articles. Sihem Amer-Yahia, Senjuti Basu Roy, Ashish Chawla, Gautam Das and Cong Yu. “Group Recommendation: Semantics and Efficiency”. VLDB 2009. The need for group recommendation arises in many scenarios: a movie for friends to watch together, a travel destination for a family to spend a holiday break, and so on. We consider the problem of group recommendation where each group is formed by a set of users. The central idea is to aim at returning items which are more likely to be liked by each member in the group. We investigate several properties critical to group recommendation, and design efficient algortihms. Senjuti Basu Roy, Haidong Wang, Ullas Nambiar, Gautam Das and Mukesh Mohania. “DynaCet: Building Dynamic Faceted Search Systems over Databases”. Demo paper, ICDE 2009. In this demo, we present DynaCet - a domain independent system that provides effective minimum-effort based dynamic faceted search solutions over enterprise databases. At every step, Dynacet suggests facets depending on the user response at previous step. Facets are selected based on their ability to rapidly drill down to the most promising tuples, as well as on the ability of the user to provide desired values for them. The benefits provided include faster access to information stored in databases while taking into consideration the variance in user knowledge and preferences. Senjuti Basu Roy and Gautam Das “Top-k Implementation Techniques of Minimum Effort Driven Faceted Search For Databases”. Accepted in COMAD 2009. We investigate opportunities to improve the performance of minimum effort driven Faceted search techniques. The main idea is motivated by the early stopping techniques used in the TA-family of algorithms for top-k computations. Senjuti Basu Roy, Haidong Wang, Gautam Das, Ullas Nambiar and Mukesh Mohania “Minimum-Effort Driven Dynamic Faceted Search in Structured Databases”. In Proc. CIKM 2008: 13-22. We investigate how Faceted Search can be enabled over structured databases for tuple search. Our Facet Selection techniques rely on selecting facets dynamically based on user response using minimum effort based techniques in principle. Senjuti Basu Roy, Gautam Das and Sajal K.

Senjuti Basu Roy, Kausik Kayal and Jaya Sil. “Edge Preserving Image Compression Technique using Adaptive Feed Forward Neural Network.” EuroIMSA 2005: 467-471. The aim of this work is to develop an edge preserving image compression technique using one hidden layer feed forward neural network of which the neurons are determined adaptively. The network is trained using the single processed image block. The work proposes initialization of weights between the input and lone hidden layer by transforming pixel coordinates of the input pattern block into its equivalent one-dimensional representation.Our research Connections Careers About us Microsoft Translator | All Downloads Events Groups News People Projects Publications Videos Data Management, Exploration and Mining (DMX) Overview The Data Platforms and Analytics pillar currently consists of the Data Management, Mining and Exploration Group (DMX) group, which focuses on solving key problems in information management. Our current areas of focus are infrastructure for large-scale cloud database systems, reducing the total cost of ownership of information management, enabling flexible ways to query, browse and organize rich data sets containing both structured and unstructured data, and the management of database schemas and mappings. Our research focuses on research projects that produce practical software. Our software has shipped in many Microsoft products and services, including the Database Tuning Advisor (in SQL Server), the Fuzzy Lookup and Fuzzy Grouping operators (Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and used in Bing Maps and Bing Shopping), the mapping compiler for Microsoft’s ADO.NET Entity Framework, the schema-matching algorithm in Microsoft’s BizTalk Mapper, click-through prediction in Bing search, and the advertisement indexing engine in search advertising, among others. Our research has also had significant impact in the academic community. We publish in the top conferences in the areas of systems, information retrieval, and database management (SIGMOD, VLDB, SIGKDD, SIGIR, WWW, ICDE, CIDR, etc.). Our work has spawned two VLDB 10-Year Best Paper Awards, and Best Paper awards at SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE and CIDR, and a ICDE Influential paper Award.   News: Sudipto Das has won the 2013 SIGMOD Jim Gray Doctoral Dissertation Award, honoring the best PhD thesis in database systems of the past year, for his thesis titled \"Scalable and Elastic Transactional Data Stores for Cloud Computing Platforms,\" at U.C.

Close this window... Copyright © 2005, Highline Community College  Writing and Data Graphics Towards Better Writing Here is a list of books that I found to be useful in learning how to write, along with my (necessarily idiosyncratic) perspective on them. (This list is still under construction!) Elements of Style, 3rd ed., William Strunk, Jr. and E. B. White, 1979 Elements of Grammar, Margaret Shertzer, 1986 Modern English Usage, 2nd ed., H. W. Fowler, 1965 These books are the \"standard\" references for the basic rules of grammar and style. Knowledge of (but not necessarily absolute adherence to) the so-called rules of grammar and style is essential to good writing. The Fowler book is the classic reference (the first edition was published in 1926, the second in 1965) and set the direction of usage for many years. I personally tend to look at all three books to see what they have to say about a particular issue, to get a sense of why the rule is the way it is. Sometimes, the rules acknowledge different practices (e.g., Strunk and White say to put a comma before the “and” in a series of terms, and Shertzer agrees, but she says that some writers prefer to omit the comma before the “and”), so it is wise to look at all the books. I tend to put less weight on Fowler\'s advice, since it was written a little earlier. As a fun exercise, try looking up the following things: The standard rule for the use of \"that\" and \"which\" as relative pronouns is as follows: use \"that\" for a restrictive clause, and use \"which\" for a nonrestrictive clause. When does one deviate from this rule? Why is a split infinitive bad? For a nonrestrictive clause, when do you use a pair of commas, a pair of dashes, or a set of parentheses to set off the clause?   Webster\'s Dictionary of English Usage, 1989 What I like about this book on usage is that it explains the history of the concept in question. That is, it treats the rules of grammar as an ongoing evolution of rules, so that one can intelligently decide whether and how to break the rules. (For example, take a look under split infinitive.) The Well-Tempered Sentence: A Punctuation Handbook for the Innocent, the Eager, and the Doomed, Karen Elizabeth Gordon, 1983 The Transitive Vampire: A Handbook of Grammar for the Innocent, the Eager, and the Doomed, Karen Elizabeth Gordon, 1984 I mention these two books only because they provide humorous (and often perverse) examples of the rules of grammar and punctuation. Also, if the other books can\'t answer a question, then these books might. From The Well-Tempered Sentence: A hyphen connects parts of some compound words used as nouns or adjectives. It is also used in some words formed with prefixes. \"That was a curiosity-provoking peepshow,\" said the pseudosophisticated ball-of-fire to the pink-faced stick-in-the-mud as they cuddled halfheartedly over a pint of bitter in a Neo-Gothic hole-in-the-wall. From The Transitive Vampire: A dependent clause is incapable of standing on its own two feet (even though they are a subject and a verb) and therefore depends on some other part of the sentence. It is not that the dependent clause is lacking in the components of an independent clause; it is reduced to this abject condition by the subordinate conjunction that introduces it. I fondled his lapel before I caressed his socks. If she capitulates, we will reward her with a lollipop. If this is love, I\'ve made a terrible mistake. If you let out the cat, I\'ll let out the last word. Elements of Editing: A Modern Guide for Editors and Journalists, Arthur Plotnik, 1982 I have not read this book too carefully yet, but it covers all of the essential elements of editing (and pitfalls). One piece of advice this book that seems sound is not to be too compulsive about marking up manscripts on points of style. (\"Signs of Dysfunctional (Editor-Related) Compulsiveness: Holding to favorite rules of usage, whatever the effect on communication\") On Writing Well, 6th ed., William Zinsser, 1998 Writing to Learn, William Zinsser, 1988 These books are inspirational, and they contain more information about how to write than any book on usage or style. Good writing is defined not by the adherence to the rules of grammar, but by the conveyance of ideas in a clear and concise way, which may involve breaking rules occassionally. I have just begun to read Writing to Learn, but On Writing Well is a fantastic book that describes the purpose and pitfalls of writing. Although the book is targeted for writing that is geared toward magazines, many of the principles given in the book (e.g., simplicity and clarity) apply to all writing. Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences, Nicholas Higham, 1993 This book is a kind of catalog of the elements in mathematical writing. It covers topics such as theorems, symbols, equations, etc. It discusses the process of revision. It also covers issues of interest to academics in general: how to deal with citations, publishing a paper, and writing a talk. The Art of Fiction, John Gardner This book is specific to fiction writing. The single most important idea of this book is the concept of the \"fictional dream\". The idea is that one effect of good writing in fiction is that the reader is always in a dream state, actions taking place before the reader\'s imaginary eyes. Part 1 of the book is essentially an essay on the purpose of fiction, which is to understand the Truth. Not scientific truth, of course, but of fictional truth, which can be as powerful or more powerful than the truth of nonfiction. Part 2 of the book gets into particular techniques of fiction writing. There are also useful exercises at the end of the book. The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage, 1976. This handbook is useful for things like when to capitalize \"North\" (e.g., when referring to a geographical region of the United States) or how to punctuate something like \"the 1970\'s\". Admittedly, the rules are a bit arbitrary, since these rules, for the most part, have not changed over the past 100 years. However, if the other style books can\'t answer the question, then this book might.   Towards Better Data Graphics Here is a list of books about graphics and data graphics that I found useful. How to Lie With Statistics, Darrel Huff, 1954 This book is the classic book on graphing data. It explains how graphs can be misleading using certain constructions. Besides being a manual for how to spot misleading graphs, it also (indirectly) provides a set of principles to construct graphs. The Elements of Graphing Data, William Cleveland, 1985 This book is a fairly comprehensive catalog of methods to graph data. It provides principles by which graphs should be constructed (e.g., \"Make the data stand out. Avoid superfluity.\"). It covers many topics, including tick marks, scales, scatterplots, three or more quantitative variables, etc. The principles are sound, and some directly contradict Huff\'s advice (e.g., Huff says to always put \"0\" in the scale). There are many examples that explain the principles involved. For every \"bad\" example, there is a \"correct\" example that illustrates the point. The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd ed., Edward Tufte Envisioning Information, Edward Tufte Visual Explanations, Edward Tufte These books are simply fantastic. While not nearly as complete in terms of elements, these books explain, perhaps more clearly than any other book, the spirit and purpose of conveying information visually. They are what to data graphics as Zinsser\'s books are to writing. Visual Display provides a theory of data graphics. There is a pretty wild redesign of the scatterplot, a design that follows from the principles of the book. Envisioning Information provides a catalog of methods to convey information (e.g., micro/macro readings, small multiples). Some of the advice contradicts Cleveland\'s (e.g., always put a box around the data area).  Visual Explanations continues on Tufte\'s theme of uncluttered data presentation (a theme also mentioned in Elements of Style, but with respect to writing) by talking about how data presentation can be used to support an argument or provide an explanation. Simply amazing books.  Some Readings Here is a list of computer science and mathematics books that I found interesting. How To Solve It, 2nd ed., G. Polya.  (1957) A classic book on how to solve mathematics (and other) problems.  The techniques can be generalized to all kinds of problems, including computer science problems.  Some problem solving techniques discussed include: analogy, checking your result, generalization, symmetry, working backwards.  A must read for anyone serious about solving problems. The Cartoon Guide to Computers, Larry Gonick.  (reprinted from a book called The Cartoon Guide to Computer Science, 1983) An irreverent, but useful guide to the fundamentals of computing.  From counting on fingers to vacuum tubes to the modern digital computer, this book talks about the concepts that form the basis of computers.  Topics include: hardware, Turing machines, algorithms.  It\'s a little dated now, but the discussion on hardware is pretty good. Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, Douglas Hofstadter.  (1999, not sure what edition it is, but it\'s the 20th anniversary edition (first edition was 1979)) It\'s hard to give any kind of a description of an amazingly deep book such as GEB.  Hofstadter discusses a wide collection of topics related to philosophy, metaphysics, computers, and the mind.  The subtitle of the book is \"A Metaphorical Fugue on Minds and Machines in the Spirit of Lewis Carroll.\"  Hofstadter uses \"normal\" prose to explain his ideas, but his innovation is the use of dialogs between the ficticious characters of Lewis Carroll\'s Alice in Wonderland (and other characters as well). Anyone interested in the mind or the limits of computers, or just curious about what the universe is all about should read this book. Engines of Logic: Mathematicians and the Origin of the Computer, Martin Davis. (2001, originally called The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing, published in 2000) A discussion of the mathematical and theoretical ideas that led to the invention of the modern computer.  Mathematical ideas in the area of logic and set theory led to interesting debates.  It all culminated with Godel when he proved his completeness and incompleteness theorems.  Alan Turing took those ideas and created a formal model of computation, now called the Turing machine.  John von Neumann took Turing\'s ideas even further and created one of the first working electronic computers. Davis, a fixture in the theory of computing, complements the mathematical ideas with details about the mathematicians\' lives.  He also knew several of the people that he discusses, so his book is very personal. Surreal Numbers, Donald E. Knuth.  (1974) Two people are stranded on a deserted island and invent mathematics from first principles, with a few hints from some relics left behind by people who had been on the island before.  This is a wonderfully innovative approach to explaining things.  As Knuth says:     I have prepared Surreal Numbers as a mathematical dialogue of the 1970\'s, emphasizing the nature of creative mathematical explorations.  Of course, I wrote this mostly for fun, and I hope it will transmit the same pleasure to its readers, but I must admit that I also had a serious purpose in the back of my mind.  Namely, I wanted to provide some material which would help to overcome one of the most serious shortcomings in our present educational system, the lack of training for research work; there is comparatively little opportunity for students to experience how new mathematics is invented, until they reach graduate school.     I decided that creativity can\'t be taught using a textbook, but that an \"anti-text\" such as this novel might be useful.  I therefore tried to write the exact opposite of Landau\'s Grundlagen der Mathematik; my aim was to show how mathematics can be \"taken out of the classroom and into life,\" and to urge the reader to try his or her own hand at exploring abstract mathematics.College and the Art of Life David Salesin, Convocation Address, 28 September 2003   I want to thank Provost Thorud, President Huntsman, the Regents, the faculty, and especially the class of 2007  and their parents!  for giving me this extraordinary opportunity to be with you here today. Its a special privilege to be able to welcome you to one of the great universities of the world, the University of Washington. Founded in 1861  28 years before the state of Washington itself  the U-Dub now draws a total of 43,000 students from all 50 states and 99 countries. Its faculty and alumni include 8 Nobel Laureates, 9 Pulitzer Prize winners, and 13 MacArthur Genius Award winners. Youre joining quite a crowd here at UW  and youve earned it!   Its no doubt a huge change for you coming to a large university like this. And this brings me to the subject I would like to speak with you about today: change, and how its likely to affect your life, for better and for worse. And how you can use your few years here to best prepare yourself for the dramatic changes you will surely witness in your lifetimes.   We already live in a time of breathtaking change. In centuries past, children could expect to live out their lives in much the same way as their parents. Not so today.   A couple of years ago, I heard National Medal of Technology winner Ray Kurzweil speak about change, and he pointed out how many of the changes we witness today are really examples of exponential growth. Exponential growth starts out slowly  if you plotted it on a curve, it would stay nearly flat for a very long time. And then suddenly, as the exponential ramps up, a new trend seems to come out of nowhere.   How many people in this audience have ever heard of the Internet? How many of you had heard of it 10 years ago, in 1993? How about 20 years ago, in 1983? (Ok, maybe thats not a fair question for some of you!) The Internet is a perfect example of exponential growth. In fact, the Internet has been around for quite a long time  since 1969, actually, when the original backbone of four computers was hooked up. But very few people were aware of it until the exponential took off.   All kinds of other technologies are still in the ramping up stage, but theyll be in your lives soon. Nanotechnology is one example. Weve got scientists here at UW, like Electical Engineering Professor Karl Bohringer, who are making ever smaller electromechanical devices. It is estimated that such devices are literally shrinking in size by a factor of 5 in each linear dimension every decade  another exponential. Genome sequencing is another such area. When the 15-year human genome project was first announced back in 1990, critics charged that it would take 10,000 years to sequence the whole human genome! But they were forgetting about exponential growth. In the end, the project came in 2 years ahead of schedule.                          So what are the implications of all this exponential growth in so many areas of technology? I think they are huge! Unimaginably huge! In the next 20-25 years, we will see a whole century of progress at todays rate. But thats just the beginning. Because the very rate of progress is itself an example of exponential growth. By the end of the century, well see 20,000 years of progress at todays rate. That corresponds to a thousand times more change than the last century  which was already pretty dramatic!   Human longevity, by the way, is also increasing exponentially. For most of human existence, life expectancy ranged from 20 to 30 years. In the 18th century, we added a few days every year. By 1840, Swedish women held the world record for life extension: 45 years. Over the 19th century, life expectancy started increasing by a few weeks each year. Today, in industrialized countries, life expectancy is around 80  and growing by four months a year. You can see where this is going. By some estimates, within a decade well be adding more than one year per year to the human life span! So  hang in there!   Most of you Freshman especially are likely to live for a very long time. And in that time, you will witness  and experience  some truly dramatic changes. Take computers. Right now, a computer is basically a brittle thing that you have on your desk or cart around with you. This is sure to change. Computers will essentially disappear. Theyll become embedded in the environment, woven into your clothing, and quite possibly even implanted into your body and mind. This is not just science fiction. For instance, UW Professor Tom Furness has developed a retinal display that uses a low-powered laser to draw an image right onto your retina. Ive tried it myself (though it was a little scary, I have to admit!). In my own department, Professor Chris Diorio is collaborating with Zoology Professor Tom Daniel  one of those MacArthur Award winners  to implant microcomputers into the brains of live marine mollusks. Elsewhere, experimenters are already implanting chips into human brains, restoring limited hearing and sight to people who were once deaf or blind.   What will life be like when humans have memory and intelligence augmented by computers  computers that have greater computational power and memory capacity than their human hosts  and possibly even more power and capacity than the whole human race combined? Exciting, yes? But scary too!   These are the kinds of challenges you will face in your lifetimes.   And these are not the only challenges you will face. You have only to look at the state of the world today to get a sense of what may lie ahead.   Take this past year, which has been marked by frequent and very graphic reminders of the effects of environmental disruption. In May and June, India and Pakistan were hit with a 125-degree heat wave that killed 1200 people in a single week. Just last month, record-breaking temperatures all over Europe killed nearly 15,000 people in France alone! This sounds like science fiction  something happening in some strange dystopian future, but its happening already, today.   Closer to home, average winter temperatures in Alaska have warmed by eight degrees over the last three decades. Polar ice volume has already decreased 42% in that time, and scientists are warning that the summer Arctic ice cap could disappear entirely by mid-century. Just this week, the New York Times reported that the largest Arctic ice shelf, a 3000-year old, 100-foot thick layer of ice, has recently disintegrated, releasing a huge layer of accumulated fresh water into the sea.   Where will this lead? What does all this matter? UW Professor William H. Calvin has one theory. By examining the fossil record, hes discovered that the earth is prone to sudden, dramatic reversals in temperature. And he believes that, paradoxically, our current warming trend could trigger just such a change, sending us back to ice-age temperatures within the span of a single decade. How could this happen? Its a long story, but basically, he has predicted that the melting polar caps could release sudden large quantities of fresh water into the ocean  as this weeks news confirms  which could in turn shut down the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream, as you may know, is the warm current flowing north from the tropics that keeps Europe about 15 degrees warmer than similar latitudes on Earth. Without the Gulf Stream, Calvin estimates that Europes climate would support only 5% of its current population, and he predicts that the sudden loss of resources and resulting population crash could easily lead to global war. All this, triggered by a climate change that could take place within the course of a single decade.   These are the kinds of challenges you will face in your lifetimes.   Dramatic climate change would affect everyone on earth directly. But, living in the U.S., we are largely insulated from other problems that confront much of the world today. I recently heard Bill Gates give a lecture at Microsoft where he imagined what would happen if you randomly reshuffled the world  so that rich people lived right next door to poor people. Suppose you did this, and that there were 100 people on your street. Nearly half your neighbors would suffer from malnutrition. About 13 of the people would be chronically hungry. One in 12 of the children on your street would die of some mostly preventable disease by the age of 5: from measles, malaria, or diarrhea. One in 12. If we came face to face with these inequities every day, I believe we would already be doing something more about them.   Lets take the example just a little bit further. On your street of 100 people, there would be a total of 8 or 9 cars. Of course, the 5 people on your street from the U.S.  lets call it a family of 5, for arguments sake  would own 2 of those cars. The same family of 5 would also possess 60% of the wealth of the whole street. Finally, of all the people on the entire street, you  and you alone  would be the one person with the benefit of a college education.   It really is a special privilege to be at a university such as this.   How are you going to make the most of this opportunity? How will you use your college education to prepare yourself not just for your first job after college, but for the enormous challenges you and the world will face? This is the question I would like to turn to now.   As Ive said, most of you will live for a very long time. You will see many changes and confront many challenges. The art of life is learning to cope with those changes and challenges, to adapt to and influence them, to seek the value in them, and, ultimately, hopefully, to embrace them.   If you let it, college can prepare you for the art of life. Think of your learning as practice. Given the expanding rate of change, you cannot possibly know now even what it is that you will need to know in a few decades time. So youre practicing when you learn something here. And all your life youll be practicing.   I should probably just end the talk here, but, being a computer scientist, I am never satisfied just to stick to high-level principles, like learn how to think, or learn how to learn  however important they may be. Personally, I want to know how to reduce principles like these into practice  how to implement them in some way in my daily life. So, Ive come up with 11 suggestions, or exhortations, if you will  11 concrete things you can do, as you begin your college years here tomorrow, to prepare yourselves for the kinds of challenges you will face in your lifetimes.   Here we go....   #1: Become an expert in something!                                                                                                 Its not the expertise itself thats so important, at least at this stage in your career. Whats important is learning to become an expert in something, anything  how to go beyond the introductory material in a field and attain a level of depth that allows you to at least read the primary literature and perhaps even contribute to the fields body of knowledge yourself. If you learn how to become an expert in one thing, those skills will be surprisingly easy to transfer to another, whenever you need to, later in your career and life.   #2: Branch out!                                        You need to become an expert in something. But dont stop there: Study diverse subjects as well! Take a writing class! Take up a musical instrument! Learn a new language! Take a studio art class  or a class in art history! Or, if youre an Art major, take an introductory programming class! Youll never be in an environment like this again, where so much is so readily available to you, with top departments and faculty in virtually every field imaginable. Take advantage of it! Above all  you engineers especially!  dont neglect the humanities. History, philosophy, literature: these subjects will help develop your awareness of the world as well as your own self-awareness, preparing you for the many moral and ethical challenges you will face in your professional careers.   #3: Find a community!   The UW is a big place. If you havent noticed this already, you certainly will tomorrow, when the rest of the 43,000 student body shows up! How do you cope with that? Heres one suggestion: Find yourself a community within the university. It could be your academic department. Or it could be a community built around an extra-curricular activity, like an athletic team, a political action group, or any of the fine charitable organizations on campus. Choose a community that shares your values and provides a supportive environment.                                                  #4: Find a mentor!   You may not realize this, but as an undergraduate at UW, there are all kinds of opportunities for working one-on-one with faculty on individual study projects or research. Take advantage of them! Ask around; use the Internet. Find out whos doing exciting work, and whos working with undergrads. The mentors I was fortunate enough to find were perhaps the most vital part of my entire undergraduate experience  and, whats more, these mentorships have evolved into close friendships that continue to this day.   #5: Collaborate!   Professors are not the only people you can learn from here. Your peers are an amazing resource: You can learn a lot from them too! Im not only talking about the students in your own field. You will learn even more from people in totally different disciplines, whose talents, skills, and working styles may be nothing like your own. You can meet all kinds of people from all over the world here at UW. Take this opportunity to expand your horizons!                                   #6: Take risks (except, of course, with your health!), be experimental, challenge yourself!   Get used to operating outside your comfort zone. This is how you will truly learn, and grow. Dont shy away from challenges just because they seem too difficult. Acknowledge that fear  its a very legitimate sensation  and then take the plunge! How else are you going to stretch yourself and discover your potential? And what safer place to do it than in your four years of college? Dont be afraid to take a chance!   #7: Remain open to opportunities!   In college  as in the rest of your life  you will undoubtedly be faced with many disappointments. Perhaps that class you really wanted to take is full up, or is no longer being offered. Or perhaps you werent able to fully achieve that ambitious goal you set for yourself. Dont despair! As Albert Einstein once said, In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity! Or, as the great Bob Marley put it, When one door is closed, when one door is closed, many more is open.   Two examples, a little one and a big one:   Little one first. I love to run. But last week, at a group retreat on the Washington coast, I couldnt because I had injured my foot. Rather than giving up on exercise altogether, I brought my bicycle down  and discovered a beautiful new cycling trail weaving through the dunes that I would have never noticed if my foot had been well.   Big one. A great tragedy befell my wife when she was an undergrad in college. She lost her only brother in a car accident. To be closer to her parents she transferred schools  and there discovered a love for a whole new academic discipline, Chinese literature, which is now her career.   So, a loss  be it minor or huge  can often lead to new possibilities. Get really good at discovering what those possibilities  those opportunities  are! (And the more you take my advice to challenge yourself and take risks, the more you will be able to practice this!)   #8: Maintain balance so you wont burn out!   College is such an amazing time of freedom. For many of you, this is the first time in your life when its completely up to you, and you alone, to decide what you study, what activities you engage in, and how you structure your day. One idea I came up with as an undergrad was to try to maintain balance by making sure I engaged in four different types of activities every single day. These were:   something intellectual (not so difficult at school);   something physical (like running, biking, a team sport);   something creative (like music, art, or writing); and   something social (like lunch with a friend).   Actually, this simple rule served me so well in college that I still try to follow it today. It means, of course, that I dont always get as much done as I would like in a day. (It means too that I have boatloads of email messages I still havent responded to!) But Im in it for the long haul  as I hope you all are too  and I strongly believe that living with balance is what keeps me going day after day, and what keeps me sane.   #9: Make your own path, or, as the late Joseph Campbell so famously instructed, Follow your bliss!   Following your bliss is actually very easy  in some sense its the easiest thing in the world to do. And yet it can lead to profound and unexpected results. The late Nobel Prize winning physicist Dick Feynman was feeling burned out at one point in his career. So he resolved to get back to what he really enjoyed doing  playing with physics, without worrying about whether it was useful or not. One day, he saw someone throw a plate in the air, and he was curious about its wobbling motion. Just for the fun of it, he derived some equations to describe that motion  and soon he was applying those same equations to the study of electron orbits. As Feynman described it, the whole business that I got the Nobel Prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate.   Youll find a lot of people here at UW who can give you a lot of good advice. But learn to think for yourself too. Analyze that advice, internalize what makes sense to you, and put the rest aside. Develop your own internal compass. Trust yourself, and let your common sense guide you.   #10: Keep a beginners mind!   Tomorrow, you will begin your college career. You are a Freshman  just starting out! What a great place to be! A lot of us  and I think I speak for everyone else in the room here today  would gladly trade places with you if we could!   And for good reason too. At this point, you have, almost by definition, what they call in Zen practice a beginners mind. A beginners mind is an empty mind, a ready mind. As the great Zen master Shunryu Suzuki wrote, If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginners mind there are many possibilities; in the experts mind there are few.   So keep your beginners mind! Not just through college, but throughout your life. If you can do this  if you can bring a beginners mind  an open mind, a ready mind  to every class you take, to every book you read, and, yes, to every speech you hear  if you can bring that beginners mind to your experience of every moment of every day, then I believe you will indeed be able to overcome any challenge that the coming century has in store for you.   Final exhortation, #11:   Actually, this one is yours. It belongs to you; it is for you to decide. Think of it as your first homework assignment at UW! I wont give it a due date, so you are free to edit it as much as you like  or discard it entirely, along with any of the others Ive given you here today  and invent a new one, or new ones, as you see fit. . . . You are starting anew. You are now on your own.   Welcome to the University of Washington!  TCSS 343, Autumn 2014 Handouts Course syllabus for Section A (organization, objectives, grades, schedule) Course syllabus for Section B (organization, objectives, grades, schedule) Peer assessment guidelines Assumptions that guide this course Group work in TCSS 343 Extra Resources 321, 342 review sheet: review Some mathematics basics: Exponentials, logarithms, summations Guide to proof by induction Short guide to big-Oh and algorithm analysis Motivating examples for the course Guide to pseudocode PDF Pencasts on summations and proof by induction PDF Pencast on In-class exercise #2 (parts a and b) Worksheet on the RAM model, big-Oh, and algorithm analysis (from 9/26 lecture) Some preliminaries (from 9/29 lecture) – solutions to problems 1, 2a, and 2b Analysis fundamentals (from 10/1, 10/3 lecture) Code analysis exercises (from 10/1, 10/3 lecture) More loop exercises Lecture slides about algorithm analysis (from 10/1, 10/3 lecture) Average case analysis of binary search (from 10/1, 10/3 lecture) Slides on mergesort, quicksort, quickselect (from 10/15, 10/17 lecture) Case 1 of the proof of the Master Theorem (from 10/17 lecture) The gory detail of Large Integer Multiplication (from 10/22 lecture) Binary exponentiation (from 10/29, 10/31 lecture) PDF Pencast on Dynamic Programming: Fibonacci numbers and coin changing PDF Pencast on Dynamic Programming: 0-1 Knapsack Problem (intro) Ling Ding’s slides on Dynamic Programming: part 1 Ling Ding’s slides on Dynamic Programming: part 2 Lecture slides for optimal binary search tree (from 11/12, 11/14 lecture) Lecture slides for minimum spanning trees (from 11/17, 11/19 lectures) Lecture slides for shortest paths (from 11/19, 11/21 lecture) Proof of correctness of Prim’s algorithm Lecture slides for lower bound on comparison-based sorting (from 12/1 lecture) Homework Assignments Homework #1 (SECTION A: due Friday, October 3; SECTION B: due Wednesday, October 1): hw1.pdf Homework #2 (SECTION A: due Friday, October 10; SECTION B: due Wednesday, October 8): hw2.pdf Homework #3 (SECTION A: due Friday, October 17; SECTION B: due Wednesday, October 15): hw3.pdf Homework #4 (SECTION A, B: group problem due Wednesday, October 29; programming part due Monday, November 3): hw4.pdf Starter code for hw #4:  Sort.java    BinaryHeap.java    MergesortHeapNode.java    EmptyHeapException.java PDF pencast on solving recurrence equations using repeated substitution PDF pencast on k-way merge PDF pencast on the empirical part of hw #4 Homework #5 (SECTION A, B: due Wednesday, November 5): hw5.pdf Homework #6A (SECTION A: due Friday, November 21; SECTION B: due Wednesday, November 19): hw6.pdf Homework #6B (SECTION A, B: due Wednesday, December 3) Starter code for hw #6B: SimpleGraph.java    GraphInput.java    InputLib.java    KeyboardReader.java    Vertex.java    Edge.java Peer Assessment (All peer assessment materials need to be turned in both hard copy and by e-mail.)

Computer Science Education Teaching techniques: What forms of classroom activities are more likely to lead to student learning and performance? Specific questions about what students know: What do students know about software design?  What is the relationship between knowledge about computer science fundamentals and software design? Curriculum: Given goals of a computer science program, what are effective ways of organizing a curriculum to achieve those goals? For example, what are the roles of writing, basic mathematics, ethics, and other topics in a computer science education? Algorithms and Algorithmic Analysis I have no specific problem that I am interested in here.  Any problem or application domain that involves a different or unique kind of algorithm interests me.  The analysis of such algorithms also interests me.  Some examples: parallel computation, NP-complete problems, network packet routing algorithms.Publications: Sheard, J., Carbone, A., Chinn, D., and Laakso, M.-J.

One year I wanted an erector set and microscope instead of dolls for Christmas.   I worked in more than one wind tunnel at the NASA-Langley Research Center during my graduate program. Here I am posing in front of a wind tunnel mock up of an F-5 Freedom Fighter.  In this shot I was filling in as the Flight Dynamics Officer (FDO) during one of the Space Shuttle Simulations. This is Mission Control at the Johnson Space Center at NASA Houston.   During graduate school I worked for a while on rotor accoustics at NASA-Langley. Here I am standing next to a rotor hub like those that are found on helicopters.   My Master\'s Thesis involved the estimation of aerodynamic coefficients using wind tunnel data. This is a six foot model of a Northrop F-5 fighter outfitted with sensors. The government wanted to know what it was about the F-5 design that made the aircraft so inherently stable. The models are flown manually in the full scale wind tunnel. NASCAR currently owns this facility and uses it not only to test new car designs but also to explore how race cars moving at high speeds effect the other cars around them.   In graduate school I helped perform tests in an accoustic chamber at NASA-Langley. I posed for this photo, as well as the wind tunnel photo above, so that the test facility would have a record showing the scale of the equipment used in conducting the tests.   Here at the UWT we are fortunate to have some of the finest technology available for the benefit of faculty and students. In this photo I am demonstrating the spreadsheet and chart creation capabilities of MS Excel. The work is projected onto the screen at the front of the classroom so that students can compare the work that they are doing at their individual work stations with the examples I provide.   Here I am seated at the instructor\'s station in one of the UWT\'s modern classrooms.

Abstract Background The rapid growth of the amount of publicly available reports on biomedical experimental results has recently caused a boost of text mining approaches for protein interaction extraction. Most approaches rely implicitly or explicitly on linguistic, i.e., lexical and syntactic, data extracted from text. However, only few attempts have been made to evaluate the contribution of the different feature types. In this work, we contribute to this evaluation by studying the relative importance of deep syntactic features, i.e., grammatical relations, shallow syntactic features (part-of-speech information) and lexical features. For this purpose, we use a recently proposed approach that uses support vector machines with structured kernels. Results Our results reveal that the contribution of the different feature types varies for the different data sets on which the experiments were conducted. The smaller the training corpus compared to the test data, the more important the role of grammatical relations becomes. Moreover, deep syntactic information based classifiers prove to be more robust on heterogeneous texts where no or only limited common vocabulary is shared. Conclusion Our findings suggest that grammatical relations play an important role in the interaction extraction task. Moreover, the net advantage of adding lexical and shallow syntactic features is small related to the number of added features. This implies that efficient classifiers can be built by using only a small fraction of the features that are typically being used in recent approaches. Background Nowadays, an overwhelming amount of experimental studies on gene and protein interactions are being conducted. The results of these experiments are most often described as scientific reports or articles and published in public knowledge repositories, such as Medline http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ webcite. This literature database grows at a rate of 2000 publications per week, which makes it impossible for a human to track every new experiment performed in the field. Therefore, the need for automated information extraction methods in biomedicine becomes critical, and a lot of efforts are invested in creating such methods. Recently proposed approaches for interaction extraction are based not only on explicit textual information that is contained in publications, but also on a comprehensive language analysis that includes part-of-speech (POS tags) and deep syntactic structure detection. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, researchers employ lexical information (words) along with shallow syntactic information (POS) and/or deep syntactic features (grammatical structures) (see for example [1-10]). As a consequence, extraction methods tend to become more complex, use more features and require more and more memory and computational efforts. However, little attention has been devoted to studying the individual impact of different feature types. We believe that this question is of great importance, because (1) when two types of features have a substitute rather than a complementary effect, one of them can be dropped to obtain a computationally more efficient method, and (2) dropping one type of features might make the mining algorithm more robust. The latter reason is especially relevant for lexical features since lexicons tend to be subdomain-specific. This problem can be alleviated by combining different biological phenomena in one corpus; however in practice corpora are often built for a particular organism or a particular set of proteins. Despite this fact, it is common practice in the field to train and evaluate systems on the same data set with an n-fold cross-validation technique, thus partially avoiding this lexicon-dissimilarity problem which is inherent to real-life problems. In this work, we study the impact of different feature types on the performance of a relation extraction system that uses a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with kernels as its core, since at present this is the most popular choice in the relation extraction field. In particular, we use the approach suggested by Kim et al. [6], which relies on lexical, shallow and deep syntactic features represented as parts of a dependency tree, and consequently apply Occam\'s razor principle by cutting off the former two to get rid of all lexical and shallow syntactic information. In other words, we would like to exploit different aspects of the dependency tree and compare the net advantage that is obtained by these feature types. To the best of our knowledge, besides us, only [7-9] have looked into the impact of syntactic in addition to lexical features for the protein interaction extraction task (all in the context of SVMs). Shallow syntactic features such as POS added to a lexical feature set are reported not to increase the performance of the classifier in [9], while the deep+shallow syntactic- and lexical-feature based classifier in [7] showed a poor performance when the set of lexical features is limited. Neither of these has however studied how much performance can be obtained by using only deep syntactic features. The closest to our work is [8] which compares the performance of an interaction extraction system using only lexical features versus using syntactic (both shallow and deep) features. We highlight the difference with our work at the end of Section \'Related Work\'. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, we perform an extensive evaluation of a recently published SVM-based approach [6], which was evaluated only on the LLL data set before, on 5 data sets (AIMed [11], BioInfer [12], HPRD50 [3], LLL [13] and IEPA [14]) using cross-validation as well as 10 cross-data set experiments. Secondly, we compare this approach with stripped down versions which take into account different feature subsets, and we demonstrate that omitting lexical and part of the syntactic features does not significantly change the performance of the relation extraction task. In the remainder of this paper, we first formalize the protein interaction extraction problem as a classification task (Section \'Problem Statement\') in which sentences containing protein pairs are represented by dependency trees (Section \'Interaction Representation\'). In Section \'Building a classifier\', we present the various classifiers that we use in this paper, all of them modifications of [6], and in Section \'Related Work\' we clarify the relationship with related methodologies. We continue with a description of our experimental setup and present the results on the different data sets in Section \'Results and Discussion\'. Our final conclusions are presented in Section \'Conclusion\'. Methods Problem statement Whereas the general interaction extraction task is concerned with finding all interactions among proteins in a given text, several assumptions are usually made to simplify it. The first assumption is that the extraction task is restricted to binary interactions, i.e., exactly two proteins are involved in the interaction. Secondly, the interaction is assumed to be fully expressed in one sentence, i.e., interactions which are described across several sentences are not considered. Finally, the interaction extraction task is evaluated separately from the protein name recognition task. Named entity recognition (NER) is another area of text mining, which is usually performed and evaluated separately, thus it is generally assumed that interaction extraction is performed on a text with annotated protein names ([2,3,5,15]). Let us consider the following sentence containing 4 protein names. Example 1: \"In the shaA1 mutant, sigma(H)2-dependent expression of spo0A3 and spoVG4 at an early stage of sporulation was sensitive to external NaCl.\" This sentence contains 6 protein pairs, namely shaA-sigma(H), shaA-spo0A, shaA-spoVG, sigma(H)-spo0A, sigma(H)-spoVG, and spo0A-spoVG. A protein pair is a positive instance if the original sentence expresses an interaction between members of this pair, and a negative instance if they just co-occur in the sentence. In the example above, there are two positive instances, namely sigma(H)-spo0A and sigma(H)-spoVG while the other 4 instances are negative. As such, the task of protein interaction extraction can be treated as a classification problem, to be solved by learning a suitable decision function that can separate the positive from the negative instances. In particular, we need to choose a formal protein pair representation and a machine learning algorithm. The protein pair representation should include information from the sentence that can be used to distinguish between positive and negative instances. Different approaches use different types of information (features), depending on the machine learning methods used, the available tools and the researcher\'s strategy. Although feature selection for interaction extraction has received little attention [16], several researchers [8,17] report that applying feature selection techniques significantly speeds up the processing and in some cases increases the performance of the classifier. The difference between the feature selection problem and the current approach is explained in detail in Section \'Related Work\'. Interaction representation A dependency tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence. The nodes of the tree are the words of the sentence, and the edges represent the dependencies between words. In a typed dependency tree, edges are labeled with syntactic roles. The dependency tree for the following sentence is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Dependency tree for the sentence from Example 1. Figure 1 represents the dependency tree for the following sentence: \"Sigma F1 activity regulates the processing of sigma E2 within the mother cell compartment.\" Example 2: \"Sigma F1 activity regulates the processing of sigma E2 within the mother cell compartment.\" The most relevant part of the dependency tree to collect information about the relation between the two proteins is the subtree corresponding to the shortest path between these proteins, which is shown in Figure 2a. Both protein names are replaced with dummy strings NE1 and NE2 in order to generalize the interaction pattern. Moreover, we introduce a POS dependency tree, where nodes represent part-of-speech information instead of the corresponding words. The shortest path between the two proteins in the POS dependency tree for Example 2 is represented in 2b. Note that a dependency tree contains lexical as well as deep syntactic information, while a POS dependency tree contains shallow and deep syntactic information. We can obtain a syntactic shortest path by only retaining the syntactic roles in either the shortest path or the POS shortest path, as shown in Figure 2c. Figure 3 depicts similar information for the sentence from Example 1. Figure 2. Shortest path dependency trees for the protein pair in the sentence from Example 2. Figure 2a represents the shortest path between the two proteins in the dependency tree for the sentence: \"Sigma F1 activity regulates the processing of sigma E2 within the mother cell compartment.\" Figures 2b and 2c represent respectively the corresponding POS shortest path and the syntactic path. Note that 2a contains lexical and deep syntactic information, while 2b contains shallow and deep syntactic information, and 2c contains only deep syntactic information. Figure 3. Shortest path dependency trees for one of the protein pairs in the sentence from Example 1. Figure 3 depicts the shortest path dependency trees for the protein pair sigma(H)-spo0A built from the dependency tree of the sentence: \"In the shaA1 mutant, sigma(H)2-dependent expression of spo0A3 and spoVG4 at an early stage of sporulation was sensitive to external NaCl.\" In the remainder we keep referring to these paths as (shortest path) dependency trees. Such a dependency tree can be either a lexical dependency tree (like Figure 2a or 3a), a POS dependency tree (like Figure 2b or 3b) or a syntactic dependency tree (like Figure 2c or 3c). We will use t = (N, E, L) to denote a dependency tree t consisting of a set of nodes N, a set of edges E, and a function L that maps nodes and edges to their labels. If there is an edge from node n1 to node n2, we denote this edge by e(n1, n2). Building a classifier Our feature impact study makes use of a support vector machine (SVM) approach. SVM\'s are a classification method that views input data as vectors in a high-dimensional space and attempts to induce a maximum margin hyperplane between training data points that belong to different classes. The crucial point is that the hyperplane can be represented as a linear combination of a subset of training instances (support vectors) [18]. Moreover, the selection of the appropriate support vectors can be done by using only the inner product between training examples. Hence, if the inner product can be computed efficiently, SVM\'s can induce a classifier even in a very rich feature space. In order to deal with various kinds of input data, different strategies to compute inner products (referred to as kernels) have been proposed (see e.g. [19]). In order to build a syntactic kernel, the dependency tree space has to be kernelized. Each data point of our data set is a dependency tree corresponding to a part of the sentence in which the protein pair occurs. Such a tree can be represented as a vector in the m-dimensional space made up by all subtrees in the data set [20]. More in particular, assuming that all unique subtrees in the data set are enumerated from 1 to m, the function hs(t), s ? {1,...,m}, is defined as the number of occurrences of subtree s in tree t. Then, each tree t can be represented by a vector ? (t) = {h1(t), h2(t),...,hm(t)}. A kernel function measuring the similarity between trees t1 and t2 based on whether they contain the same subtrees, is defined as the inner product (1) The underlying vector representation is very rich since the number of subtrees of a tree grows exponentially with the tree size, which makes the computation of the inner product intractable. However, the right hand side of (1) can be interpreted as the number of common subtrees of t1 and t2, and can be computed efficiently following a procedure proposed in [20]. Kim et al. [6] follow this procedure in developing an SVM classifier based on a kernel KFULL that is a combination of a kernel KLEX comparing lexical dependency trees, with a kernel KPOS comparing POS dependency trees. Note that, because of their construction, KLEX relies on lexical and deep syntactic information, while KPOS is based on shallow and deep syntactic features. We propose a way in which the kernel KFULL can be stripped down to a kernel KS, that uses only deep syntactic features. We compare the performance of all these kernels in Section \'Results and Discussion\'. For ease of explanation, in this section we follow a bottom-up approach by first defining KS, and then extending it to the full system from [6]. The trees from Figures 2a and 3a have no subtrees in common, while when we switch to a shallow or pure syntactic representation in Figures 2b,c and 3b,c, we have one common fragment, namely the subtree consisting only of the edge prep_of and its adjacent nodes. In general, we use a recursive formula to compute the number of common subtrees between dependency trees t1 and t2. This formula relies on the notion of common child pairs of node n1 in t1 and node n2 in t2, i.e. the set of pairs of nodes that have parents n1 and n2 respectively, and that are connected to these parents by the same type of edge. When traversing down the trees in search of common subtrees, these are the nodes at which we want to continue our exploration. Definition 1. Let t1 = (N1, E1, L1) and t2 = (N2, E2, L2) be dependency trees. For n1 ? N1 and n2 ? N2, the set of common child pairs is defined as Com(n1, n2) = {(x, y)| (x, y) ? N1 × N2, e(n1, x) ? E1, e(n2, y) ? E2, L1(e(n1, x)) = L2(e(n2, y))}. Definition 2. Let t1 = (N1, E1, L1) and t2 = (N2, E2, L2) be dependency trees. For n1 ? N1 and n2 ? N2, the number of common subtrees rooted at n1 and n2 is defined as The recursive formula reflects the fact that a new common subtree rooted at n1 and n2 can be found either by picking 1 of the Cm(x, y) subtrees or by adding the x/y nodes, or just by staying as is (therefore +2). 1 is subtracted from the whole result to exclude the combination with the tree consisting of the n1/n2 node only. Example 3. Let t1 and t2 be the dependency trees from Figure 2a and 3a respectively. Com(n1, n2) is the empty set for all node pairs with exception of Com(processing, expression) = {(NE2, NE2)}. Hence Cm(processing, expression) = (Cm(NE2, NE2) + 2) -1 = 1 while Cm(n1, n2) = 0 for all other node pairs. This means that there is only one common subtree between t1 and t2, rooted at the processing, expression nodes and ending at NE2. Note that the calculation above of the number of common subtrees disregards node labels, i.e., it treats dependency trees as they are shown in Figure 2c and Figure 3c. Using Definition 2 we are now able to define a kernel KS that looks only at deep syntactic information. It computes the similarity between syntactic dependency trees as the number of grammatical structures that they have in common. Definition 3. The kernel function KS is defined as (2) for syntactic dependency trees t1 and t2. Example 4. Let t1 and t2 be the syntactic dependency trees from Figure 2c and Figure 3c respectively. Since |N1| = 5 and |N2| = 3, the summation in the right hand side of (2) consists of 15 terms. In Example 3 we already established that all of these terms are 0 with the exception of one term that equals 1. Hence KS(t1, t2) = 1. To arrive at kernels that take into account additional lexical and/or shallow syntactic information, we need an extended version of Definition 1 that also looks at the labels of nodes. Definition 4. Let t1 = (N1, E1, L1) and t2 = (N2, E2, L2) be dependency trees. For n1 ? N1 and n2 ? N2, the set of common child pairs, taking into account the labels of the nodes, is defined as Comlab(n1, n2) = {(x, y)|(x, y) ? Com(n1, n2), L1(n1) = L2(n2), L1(x) = L2(y)}. The superscript \"lab\" refers to the fact that the labels of the nodes are taken into account. The appearance of Com(n1, n2) in the definition of Comlab(n1, n2) illustrates that the latter builds on the former. Furthermore, it holds that indicating that using syntactic trees leads to a more general approach (more nodes are explored when traversing down the trees in search for common subtrees). The number Cmlab(n1, n2) of common subtrees rooted at n1 and n2, can now be defined in a recursive manner entirely analogous to Definition 2, however relying on Comlab(n1, n2) instead of on Com(n1, n2). Since they have different labels at the nodes, the value of Cmlab(n1, n2) might be different depending on whether a lexical dependency tree or a POS dependency tree is used. In both cases, it holds however that (3) Example 5. Let t1 and t2 be the lexical dependency trees from Figure 2a and Figure 3a respectively. For all node pairs it holds that Comlab(n1, n2) = ?, and Cmlab(n1, n2) = 0. Example 6. Let t1 and t2 be the POS dependency trees from Figure 2b and Figure 3b respectively. It holds that Comlab(NN, NN) = {(NE2, NE2)} and Cmlab(NN, NN) = 1, while for all other node pairs Comlab(n1, n2) = ? and Cmlab(n1, n2) = 0. The potentially different behavior of Cmlab(n1, n2) on lexical dependency trees and POS dependency trees gives rise to the definitions of the kernel functions KLEX and KPOS respectively. Both of them still consider the tree structure when computing the similarity between trees, i.e. they both rely on deep syntactic information. In addition, KLEX takes the actual words of the sentence into account (lexical information) while KPOS considers POS (shallow syntactic information). Definition 5. [20] The kernel function KLEX is defined as (4) for lexical dependency trees t1 and t2. In our case function L maps words in the tree nodes to corresponding lemmas eliminating the differences arising from different word forms. Definition 6. [6] The kernel function KPOS is defined as for POS dependency trees t1 and t2. Finally, Kim et al. [6] combine KLEX and KPOS into a kernel KFULL that takes into account lexical, shallow and deep syntactic information. Definition 7. [6] The kernel KFULL is defined as (5) for dependency trees t1 and t2 and their corresponding POS dependency trees and . Notice that KLEX is a refinement of KS in the sense that all the information used by KS is also used in the same way by KLEX. As a consequence, KFULL is also a refinement of KS, enriching the deep syntactic information of KS by lexical information (through KLEX) as well as shallow syntactic information (through KPOS). Example 7. Let t1 and t2 be the lexical dependency trees from Figure 2a and Figure 3a respectively, and and their corresponding POS dependency trees from Figure 2b and Figure 3b respectively. One can verify that and hence KFULL(t1, t2) = 1. Notice that although the trees do not show any resemblance on the lexical level, their similarity at the more general syntactic level is picked up by KPOS. In Example 4 we found that their syntactic similarity is also already reflected by KS. A short summary of the kernels described above is provided in Table 1. Table 1. Kernels Related work In Table 2, an overview of recent approaches to interaction extraction is presented along with the characteristics that are relevant in the context of our work. Below we describe these approaches in more detail. Table 2. General approaches for protein interaction extraction Many approaches exploit the idea of using explicit feature vectors to represent a possible interaction. In particular, approaches based on various combinations of lexical features are very popular in the relation extraction community. Bunescu et al. [2] propose to use the sentence context, obtained by splitting a sentence into three parts, i.e. before the first protein, between the two proteins, and after the second protein, and they combine them in predefined ways to obtain 3 types of patterns. Using this information, the authors propose a kernel that naturally emerges from the subsequence kernel described in [21] and obtain good results on the AIMed corpus. Giuliano et al. [4] start from the same pattern types, but treat them as bags-of-words, and define a global context kernel. Moreover, they define a local context kernel by taking a window of predefined size around the candidate proteins and adding more shallow linguistic information, such as the lemma of the word and some orthographic features. The resulting kernel function in this case is a linear combination of the global context kernel and the local context kernel. Their method obtains state-of-the-art results on the AIMed and LLL data sets. Some researchers focus on sentence structure, i.e., on the parse and dependency tree, to construct a feature vector. Xiao et al. [9] study the impact of features, starting with simple words up to parse and dependency trees on the IEPA corpus, and they obtain a remarkable 90.9% F-score using a maximum entropy model with lexical and shallow syntactic features. Yakushiji et al. [10] suggest that full parsing information could be very useful in the biology domain because the distance between entities in a sentence can be much longer than in general-purpose domains. Therefore, they propose a method that builds complex predicate-argument structures (PAS), and apply an SVM with an RBF kernel to these patterns to obtain a classifier model. They evaluate this model on the AIMed data set and obtain a 57.3% F-score. In [5], the authors also focus on sentence structure and use dependency trees to extract the local contexts of the protein names, the root verbs of the sentence, and the parent of the protein nodes in the dependency tree. Classification is further done by BayesNet and ensemble classifiers. Another approach is proposed in [3], where a manually constructed set of rules uses information from the dependency trees and a predefined vocabulary to classify possible interaction instances. This approach is evaluated on the HPRD50 and LLL data sets, as well as on a large-scale data set consisting of 1 million MEDLINE abstracts. The extracted set of interactions contained 40% of the HPRD interaction database. In our own previous work [15], we proposed to abstract from lexical features and use only syntactic information to obtain a more general classifier that would be suitable for different data sets without retraining. We used features extracted from dependency and parse trees to build decision trees and BayesNet classifiers, and obtained promising results using AIMed as test data and LLL as training data. Another group of approaches does not rely on an explicit feature vector but rather makes use of structured data as input information for the classifier. This means that structured features, such as dependency trees, can be used as an input to the classifier without any additional transformations, thus reducing the risk of losing useful information. One particular way to use structured features that we adhere to in the current paper, is to exploit structured kernels. The approaches [1,6,7] are closest to our work as they also use structured kernels. Structured or convolution kernels were introduced in [22] by Haussler who proposed how to compute a kernel for structured objects. This work gave rise to many tree kernel methods in the text mining domain. Although this idea is quite popular in general text mining, it has not been widely explored in the interaction extraction literature. Saetre et al. [7] apply a structured kernel to the protein-protein interaction domain. In this approach, a mix of at and structured features is used to calculate the similarity of two protein pairs. The flat part of the feature vector contains lexical features, while the structured part is a shortest path dependency tree, referred to as a partial tree. This definition was introduced by Moschitti [23] who studied different tree partitioning strategies and their impact on tree kernels for dependency and parse trees. Using these fatures, Saetre et al. obtain promising results on the AIMed data set, especially in combination with a rich lexical feature set. In another very recent approach, described in [1], the authors propose to use the whole dependency tree to build a classifier. They use a graph kernel that takes into account all paths in dependency trees, and exploit it with an RLS (regularized least squares) machine learning method. The experimental evaluation is performed on 5 data sets: AIMed, BioInfer, HPRD50, IEPA and LLL, and for all of them, the method shows remarkably good results. Collins and Duffy [20] developed a tree kernel that counts the number of common subtrees, but used it for parsing and not for interaction extraction. Kim et al. [6] apply this kernel to a dependency tree and to a modified dependency tree with POS instead of words, and propose a combined kernel, which is a sum of these two. This approach obtains state-of-the-art performance on the LLL data set. In the same paper they describe a flat feature vector-based approach that also utilizes dependency trees to extract graph walks as features. In [8], the authors study the relative feature importance for the latter approach by using the gain ratio feature selection technique. Moreover, they study the impact of different feature types as well by comparing the performance of methods that use syntactic features versus methods that use lexical features. Our approach is also based on Kim\'s work, however it is different from [8] in several aspects. First of all, our approach is different from the feature selection task, because we focus on the type of the information (lexical, POS, grammatical relations) rather than on separate features. In other words, we do not use feature selection techniques to discriminate useful individual features, but fit an existing relation extraction method to consider only a subset of features of a certain type, and study the impact of this feature class. Secondly, when we study the impact of different feature types we do not rely on a flat vector, but on a structured representation. Moreover, we use an additional data set and define more extensive experimental setups in order to perform a complete study of different use cases. Results Data sets To the best of our knowledge the only publicly available data sets that contain protein interaction annotations are: AIMed [11], BioInfer [12], HPRD50 [3], LLL [13] and IEPA [14]. These data sets have been frequently used in recent work of for example [1,8,24]; therefore we use them in our current work. Table 3 gives an overview of the number of positive and negative instances in the different data sets. Table 3. Corpora statistics The AImed data set consists of 225 abstracts extracted from the Database of Interaction Proteins (DIP), 200 of which contain annotated human gene and protein interactions. Another 25 abstracts contain protein names but do not describe any interactions. We have used only the former set of abstracts for our evaluation purposes. The BioInfer data set is the largest data set among these 5; it contains 1100 sentences describing protein-protein interactions. Beside the interaction annotations, BioInfer contains additional information about biological interaction type, protein roles in interaction, syntactic dependencies between words, etc. Moreover, there is a knowledge base behind the corpus, which allows to analyse it in more detail (see [12]). HPRD50 contains sentences that were extracted from a subset of 50 abstracts, referenced by the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and annotated with protein names and interactions between them. The LLL data set consists of 76 sentences describing interactions concerning Bacillus subtilis transcription. Protein roles for interactions are annotated along with the interactions themselves. Additionally, the data set contains annotations for lemmas and syntactic dependencies between the words in the sentences. Finally, The IEPA data set was built by querying Medline with 10 diverse queries, reflecting 10 different biological topics. 303 abstracts were retrieved, and a data set was constructed with sentences extracted from these abstracts. The data set annotation includes an interacting verb along with the protein names and interactions. The BioInfer and LLL data sets provide syntactic dependencies for every sentence in their own formats, while the other data sets do not provide this information. We discarded this information to unify the setup and to make the experiment more realistic. Besides being non-standard, some of the syntactic information in BioInfer and LLL was obtained manually which violates the requirements of automatic processing. To obtain POS and dependency trees for all data sets we used the Stanford parser [25] trained on general purpose corpora. We choose this parser because of its peculiar annotation scheme that stresses the semantic connections between words rather than operating on the purely syntactic level. For example, prepositions are collapsed as can be seen in Figure 2a, where the noun processing is being connected directly to a protein name. As we use a dependency tree representation to obtain all three types of features, we do not use an external POS tagger to obtain POS tags separately; instead they are assigned as part of the dependency tree building process inside the Stanford parser. As the Stanford parser does not provide lemmatized versions of words, we used the Porter Stemmer algorithm [26] to compute KLEX and KFULL. All data sets use different annotation schemes that emphasize different interaction properties. For example, in AIMed homodimeric proteins are being annotated, i.e. proteins that interact with themselves, while the current mining approach is not able to detect such cases. Moreover, in BioInfer some proteins have gaps in annotations, i.e. there is a gap between two parts of one protein name. We handle these cases separately, but they can potentially decrease the performance of the classifier as well. The quality of the annotation itself (measured as e.g. inter-annotator agreement) may affect the quality of classifier. If an annotator misses an interaction between two proteins, the data point related to this protein pair would be treated as a negative instance, although containing an interaction pattern, which is harmful to the overall performance. To unify an experimental setup, we need to cast all corpora to a common ground format. Pyysalo et al. [27] designed custom software that converts all 5 data sets to a single XML format that contains only minimal protein and interaction annotations, which is sufficient for our evaluation purposes. However, not all annotation differences can be eliminated in this way. Table 3 shows that different data sets have very different positive/negative ratios. This can be partially explained by different annotation strategies, e.g. for LLL only proteins that are involved in interactions are annotated, while for other data sets all protein names are annotated. Since we consider every possible protein pair within a sentence to be an instance, this leads to an exponential growth of the total number of instances, while in fact the number of positive instances remains the same. Taking into account this information, we should choose our evaluation metrics carefully in order to provide a fair comparison of the performance on all data sets. Performance metrics In this work, we use two evaluation metrics, namely recall-precision and ROC (reciever operating characteristic) curves, to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the achieved results. Let us first recall their definitions. Let TP denote the number of true positives, i.e., the number of positive instances that are classified as such, let FP denote the number of false positives, i.e., the number of negative instances that are incorrectly classified as positive, and analogously, let TN and FN stand for the number of true negatives and false negatives respectively. The following metrics can then be defined: Recall stands for the fraction of correctly classified instances (TP) among all positive instances (TP+FN) in a data set, while precision denotes the fraction of correctly classified instances (TP) among all instances that are classified as positive (TP+FP). Recall is sometimes called true positive rate, while false positive rate counts how many of the negative instances were wrongly classified as positive. A combined measure, that takes into account both recall and precision is called F-score and defined as: Often, a classifier\'s output can be ordered, i.e. the classifier also provides a degree of confidence for each prediction it makes. In this case, we can trade precision for a higher recall by lowering the confidence threshold to capture more positive instances. In this way we can build a recall-precision curve that shows the relationship between the quality of extracted relations (precision) and the amount of extracted relations (recall). The closer to the top-right corner a curve is, the less precision is lost with recall growth and the better the performance of the classifier is. Precision, recall and F-score are de-facto standards for the interaction extraction evaluation. However, these metrics are very sensitive to data set skewedness, i.e., the large difference between the number of positive and negative instances. As was shown in Table 3, this difference varies greatly for different corpora. On the other hand, ROC curves are being used in the machine learning community to evaluate classifier performance and they do not depend on data set skewedness. The false positive rate together with the true positive rate correspond to a point in ROC space. By varying the trade-off between these two metrics we obtain a curve in ROC space. The AUC-score is the area under this ROC-curve. It can be interpreted as the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance. However, this metric should be used carefully for the same reason, i.e. it is suitable to evaluate the relative quality of a classifier (percentage of extracted positive instances), but it gives no information about precision, and thus makes the evaluation of a classifier difficult. For example, if we increase the number of negatives 10 times, then the number of FP on average increases 10 times as well. This will lead to a significant drop in precision and consequently in F-score, but it does not influence the false positive rate. Based on this observation, we can outline an application area for both evaluation metrics. The ROC curve and the corresponding AUC value should be used to compare the performance of a classifier on different corpora, since they show the relative number of extracted positive instances. Recall-precision and F-score can be used to compare the quality of several classifiers on the same data set, since they indicate how \'clean\' the classification is without regarding the proportion of negative instances. Experimental setup For the experiments, we used the LIBSVM library [28] to build the 4 SVM classifiers that use the KFULL kernel, KPOS kernel, KS kernel and KLEX kernel. Furthermore, we organized 3 experimental setups. The first setup uses 10-fold cross-validation (CV), where each data set is split into 10 parts, of which 9 are used for training and one for testing. Despite the fact that this is the most common way of evaluation, it should be used carefully. Since we work on instance level, it can be the case that two nearly identical instances from the same sentence fall into a train and a test fold at the same time. This \'leak\' can cause a performance boost as it was shown in [7,8]. In the second setup (4-1) we join 4 data sets to form a training set, and use the remaining one as a test set. Compared to CV, this alternative experimental setup is closer to a real world situation where information for processing is obtained from different sources and the lexicon is not as uniform as in one precompiled data set. In the last setup (1-4) we use 1 data set as training set and the remaining 4 as test sets, thus making another step to the real world. Typically, biologists have a very limited amount of annotated data compared to the size of available unlabeled information. We try to model this situation here by making the training set much smaller than the test set. For each experimental setup we run all classifiers with all data set combinations. An analysis of the results obtained is provided in the following section. Discussion Table 4 and Figures 4, 5, 6, 7 give an overview of the evaluation results for all experimental setups. In line with our evaluation metric review, we use recall-precision and ROC curves to analyze the obtained experimental results. On the basis of these results, we can make the interesting observation that the different kernels are roughly comparable, while the amount of information they use is very different. In the analysis below we will omit the +syntactic postfix when talking about the lexical+syntactic (KLEX), shallow+syntactic (KPOS) and lexical+shallow+syntactic (KFULL) kernels. Table 4.

Figure 7 depicts ROC curves for different kernels. From left top to right bottom: lexical kernel, Lexical+Shallow kernel, shallow kernel, syntactic kernel. Precision plays a particularly important role in the interaction extraction task, because if the extracted information is processed by a biologist, she would not like the system if it produces too much rubbish. Therefore, we are particularly interested in the left side of the recall-precision chart, where precision is typically high, although recall may be quite low. Table 4 shows the F-measure results calculated for classifier confidence threshold 0.5, as well as the AUC values which are not dependent on any threshold. Let us note that the F-measure values could be tuned up, because on most recall-precision charts precision does not drop significantly after a certain point, while recall keeps growing. However, this is not the aim of the current research, thus we leave the task of looking for the optimal operation point aside. Table 5 sums up our empirical observations over recall-precision curves provided in Figures 4, 5, 6, particularly on the area before 0.2-0.3 recall values. For example, Figure 4d clearly shows that lexical kernel performs best for the recall up to approximately 0.18 in this experimental setting. Using these empirical observations we fill Table 5. The table gives some insight on how different types of information affect the performance of the relation extraction system. Note that these observations are different from Table 4, because typically a 0.5 threshold covers more than 30% of recall. Below we provide a more detailed analysis of the results shown in Table 4 and in Figures 4, 5, 6. Table 5. Information types The cross-validation setup reveals no clear leader for all data sets. For the LLL data set, the syntactic kernel shows the best performance (Figure 4a). That can be explained by the fact that the LLL data set is very small and contains relatively short hand-picked sentences with a simple syntactic structure. However, experiments with other data sets show that the lexical kernel gives the best results for the HPRD50 and BioInfer data sets (Figures 5b and 4b). In the case of BioInfer, this can be explained by the fact that the training set size is large enough to discriminate useful lexical features. For IEPA, the full kernel, i.e. lexical+shallow, performs best, while the lexical kernel shows the worst result (Figure 5a), and for the AIMed data set the syntactic kernel shows better results for small recall values (Figure 6a). The predictive power of deep syntactic features by themselves is very interesting, given that the lexical and lexical+shallow methods in theory can take additional advantage of the lexicon similarity within the same data set that is caused by the nature of the cross-validation set up. When we train on 4 data sets and test on 1, the lexical+shallow kernel is among the best for all but the BioInfer data set. Figure 4d shows that the lexical kernel outperforms the others on BioInfer for small recall values. A significantly better performance of the lexical kernel for small recall values can be interpreted as a sign of overfitting, i.e. a classifier with a lexical kernel produces too specific patterns, which causes a successful classification of several instances, but is followed by a significant precision drop due to the unability to generalize over less frequent cases. On the other hand, other classifiers avoid overfitting and a steep precision drop, but at the cost of missing some very reliable patterns. Moreover, the lexical kernel shows a performance similar to the lexical+shallow kernel for HPRD50 and AIMed (Figures 5d and 6b), but fails on IEPA (Figure 5c). On the other hand, the syntactic kernel performs good on the IEPA and LLL data sets (Figures 5c and 4c), but is not that good on others. Although with the 1-4 experimental setup there is no best kernel either, we can still observe some interesting patterns. The lexical kernel shows a significantly better performance on the AIMed and HPRD50 data set for small recall values (Figures 6c and 5f), while the syntactic kernel performs best for the LLL and IEPA data sets on the whole curve (Figures 4c and 5e). As it is shown on Figure 4e, training the classifier on LLL causes extreme curve shapes caused by the significant difference in size between the training set and the test data set. The first instances for the lexical+shallow and the shallow kernels were classified correctly, but further precision drops dramatically. After 0.25 recall value, the lexical kernel basically neglects all positive instances, and the curve shows simply the percentage of positive instances in the data set. Other kernels perform slightly better and the syntactic kernel is able to consistently outperform others. This can be explained by the fact that 80 sentences (the size of the LLL data set) is definitely not enough to train a classifier. Moreover, it shows that in the case of training information shortage the syntactic kernel can offer a better solution than others. The last two experiments illustrate the case when the vocabulary of train and test data sets differ, which is often the case in the real world. In the former case the training set is large enough to successfully train the lexical+shallow kernel, making the difference in the vocabularies not so crucial. However, in the latter case, when the training set is much smaller than the test set (train on LLL case on Figure 4e) we can clearly see the influence of this fact on the performance difference between syntactic and lexical methods. From the experiments above we can observe the following trends: • lexical and combined methods are able to build better generalizations (due to large amount of available lexical data) and thus perform better with large (relative to test) training sets • syntactic methods are able to achieve better results than lexical ones when the training set is small in comparison with the test set Moreover, there seems to be a correlation between better performing kernels and data sets. For example, the syntactic kernel always obtains good results on the LLL and IEPA data sets, while the lexical+shallow kernel performs well for the BioInfer data set. Moreover, the lexical kernel is always on top for the HPRD50 data set. These observations show that the data set origin and properties (such as annotation strategy, average sentence complexity) have a strong influence on classifier performance. Compiling ROC curves for one method on one chart allows us to analyze the robustness of this method on different data sets. In Figure 7 each chart displays ROC curves for one method for all experimental setups. The less spread the curves are in the ROC space, the more predictable the performance of the method is. In most cases, the LLL cross-validation setup is out of the trend, because of its small size and density. Otherwise, the shallow (Figure 7c) and syntactic (Figure 7a) kernels exhibit more or less coherent behavior for all setups for the given data sets. The lexical+shallow kernel (Figure 7d) shows some spread, but again mostly due to the LLL data set\'s based setups, and the lexical kernel (Figure 7b) proves to be the most unpredictable. Conclusion In this paper we examined different structured kernels with SVM\'s to study the impact of different features on the relation extraction process. We took four kernels that reflect different degrees of using syntactic and lexical information and performed three types of experiments to study the behaviour of these methods under different conditions. We performed our experiments on five benchmark data sets, being AIMed, BioInfer, IEPA, HPRD50 and LLL. The most important observation is that by using only grammatical relations (syntactic kernel) we can obtain a similar performance as with an extended feature set (lexical kernel). This indicates the relative importance of grammatical information for the interaction extraction task. Another finding is the correlation between training/test set sizes and the method choice. We observed that when the training set is much smaller than the test set, then the syntactic kernel performs better. This might be explained by the fact that there are too few instances to induce useful lexical features, whereas syntactic features require less instances to produce better results. When the training set grows, the performance of the full kernel becomes better, and when the training data set is larger than the test set (which rarely happens in real life), the full kernel outperforms all other kernels. From the stability point of view (i.e., the expected performance on unseen data), we can conclude that the syntactic kernel provides the best results, whereas the lexical kernel provides the worst results. The question of how different features within one feature type affect the quality of classification still remains open and represents an interesting direction for future work. We believe that these findings can be helpful in building faster and less complicated classifiers, as well as for choosing a proper kernel according to the data set at hand.

The winning teams were announced at KDD 2013, the 19th annual conference of ACM SIGKDD (the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) which took place in Chicago in August. KDD is the premier event for researchers grappling with today’s data deluge, as it’s the only conference spanning big data, data mining, data science, and analytics and all the related algorithms, foundations, applications, and practices. 2013 KDD Cup challenge winners, Team Algorithm, from National Taiwan University The 2013 KDD Cup challenge focused on the ability to search literature and to collect metrics around publications—a capability that is essential to modern research, as academic and industry researchers increasingly rely on search to discover what has been published and by whom. The competition made use of a data set of 250,000 authors and 2.5 million published papers. The dataset was broken up into a distinct labeled training set, a validation set for the leaderboard, and a test set. The competitors faced two tasks: first, a prediction task to determine whether an author had written a paper, and second, a name disambiguation task to identify duplicate author names in a dataset with name variants. These tasks go to the heart of one of the main challenges of information extraction and curation in any people-centric dataset: resolving people-name ambiguity. In the scholarly publishing world, many authors publish under several variations of their own name, and to add to the complexity of discovery, different authors might share a similar or even the same name. As a result, the profile of an author with an ambiguous name tends to contain noise, resulting in papers that are incorrectly assigned to him or her. The KDD Cup task challenged participants to determine which papers in an author profile were truly written by a given author. Read the full parameters of the challenge. The competition was fierce, with more than 800 teams from more than 40 different countries developing approximately 12,000 data-mining models over the course of a few months. The winning solution, created by Professor Chih-Jen Lin and Team Algorithm from National Taiwan University, was the product of outstanding teamwork: eighteen students and three teaching assistants actually designed a graduate course around the competition. Other winners included teams from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Moscow State University, and FICO. Winners presented their solutions at a KDD Cup workshop and poster session at the conference. Moreover, solutions created for the competition resulted in 10 research papers that are available through the KDD Cup 2013 Workshop proceedings. KDD Cup poster session participants at KDD 2013 On behalf of Microsoft Research Connections, I would like to thank the key collaborators who helped make this competition a success. The Microsoft Research Connections proposal for the KDD Cup challenge was selected after careful deliberation by 2013 KDD Cup chairpersons Claudia Perlich and Brian Dalessandro of Media6°. Partnering with me in designing the contest rules and evaluation criteria were Professors Martine DeCock of Ghent University and Senjuti Basu Roy of the University of Washington Tacoma, along with Ben Hamner and Will Cukierski of Kaggle. Swapna Savvana and Yitao Li from the University of Washington Tacoma helped with the logistics of the contest execution. So congrats to the KDD Cup winners, and kudos to everyone who accepted the challenge. The many outstanding solutions showed great creativity, which is exactly what we’ll need as we move forward in this new world of data-intensive scientific inquiry. —Vani Mandava, Senior Program Manager, Microsoft Research Connections Learn more KDD (Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) KDD 2013 proceedings ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Education and Scholarly Communication at Microsoft Research Connections 0 Comments Chicago, scholarly communication, algorithms, Moscow State University, Data mining, data, big data, data science, analytics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, publication metrics, Association of Computing Machinery, Will Cukierski, information extraction, curation, Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Team Algorithm, FICO, Swapna Savvana, Vani Mandava, Prof. Chih-Jen Lin, scholarly publishing, Ben Hamner, 2013 KDD Cup challenge, National Taiwan University, Yitao Li, Microsoft Research Connections KDD 2013 ACM SIGKDD, Senjuti Basu Roy, Martine DeCock Leave a Comment Name Comment Please add 8 and 1 and type the answer here: Post Publishing An error occurred while posting!

Recent Events Please join us in congratulating Yiru Li, Sarah George, Craig Apfelbeck, Abdeltawab Hendawi, David Hazel, Ankur Teredesai and Mohamed Ali on winning the \"Best Demo\" award at the ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS Conference 2014  on the iTornado system. The paper is titled: “Routing Service With Real World Severe Weather” and presents a framework for routing services to evacuate vehicles under real world severe weather threats. The system is able to: (1) Identify the users inside the dangerous region of a severe weather event, (2) Recommend an evacuation route to guide the users out to a safe destination or shelter, (3) Assure the recommended route to be one of the shortest paths after excluding the risky area, and  (4) Maintain the flow of traffic by normalizing the evacuation on the possible safe routes. For additional information, please visit the Geospatial Data Management page of the Center for Data Science: http://cwds.uw.edu/geospatial-data-management” Dr. George Mobus, Associate Professor in Computer Science & Systems and Computer Engineering & Systems, has just had his textbook (along with co-author Professor Emeritus Michael Kalton of IAS) entitled Principles of Systems Science published by Springer, New York. This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. The book contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. Please join us in congratulating Dr. Mobus on this major accomplishment.

Abstract Background The rapid growth of the amount of publicly available reports on biomedical experimental results has recently caused a boost of text mining approaches for protein interaction extraction. Most approaches rely implicitly or explicitly on linguistic, i.e., lexical and syntactic, data extracted from text. However, only few attempts have been made to evaluate the contribution of the different feature types. In this work, we contribute to this evaluation by studying the relative importance of deep syntactic features, i.e., grammatical relations, shallow syntactic features (part-of-speech information) and lexical features. For this purpose, we use a recently proposed approach that uses support vector machines with structured kernels. Results Our results reveal that the contribution of the different feature types varies for the different data sets on which the experiments were conducted. The smaller the training corpus compared to the test data, the more important the role of grammatical relations becomes. Moreover, deep syntactic information based classifiers prove to be more robust on heterogeneous texts where no or only limited common vocabulary is shared. Conclusion Our findings suggest that grammatical relations play an important role in the interaction extraction task. Moreover, the net advantage of adding lexical and shallow syntactic features is small related to the number of added features. This implies that efficient classifiers can be built by using only a small fraction of the features that are typically being used in recent approaches. Background Nowadays, an overwhelming amount of experimental studies on gene and protein interactions are being conducted. The results of these experiments are most often described as scientific reports or articles and published in public knowledge repositories, such as Medline http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ webcite. This literature database grows at a rate of 2000 publications per week, which makes it impossible for a human to track every new experiment performed in the field. Therefore, the need for automated information extraction methods in biomedicine becomes critical, and a lot of efforts are invested in creating such methods. Recently proposed approaches for interaction extraction are based not only on explicit textual information that is contained in publications, but also on a comprehensive language analysis that includes part-of-speech (POS tags) and deep syntactic structure detection. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, researchers employ lexical information (words) along with shallow syntactic information (POS) and/or deep syntactic features (grammatical structures) (see for example [1-10]). As a consequence, extraction methods tend to become more complex, use more features and require more and more memory and computational efforts. However, little attention has been devoted to studying the individual impact of different feature types. We believe that this question is of great importance, because (1) when two types of features have a substitute rather than a complementary effect, one of them can be dropped to obtain a computationally more efficient method, and (2) dropping one type of features might make the mining algorithm more robust. The latter reason is especially relevant for lexical features since lexicons tend to be subdomain-specific. This problem can be alleviated by combining different biological phenomena in one corpus; however in practice corpora are often built for a particular organism or a particular set of proteins. Despite this fact, it is common practice in the field to train and evaluate systems on the same data set with an n-fold cross-validation technique, thus partially avoiding this lexicon-dissimilarity problem which is inherent to real-life problems. In this work, we study the impact of different feature types on the performance of a relation extraction system that uses a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with kernels as its core, since at present this is the most popular choice in the relation extraction field. In particular, we use the approach suggested by Kim et al. [6], which relies on lexical, shallow and deep syntactic features represented as parts of a dependency tree, and consequently apply Occam\'s razor principle by cutting off the former two to get rid of all lexical and shallow syntactic information. In other words, we would like to exploit different aspects of the dependency tree and compare the net advantage that is obtained by these feature types. To the best of our knowledge, besides us, only [7-9] have looked into the impact of syntactic in addition to lexical features for the protein interaction extraction task (all in the context of SVMs). Shallow syntactic features such as POS added to a lexical feature set are reported not to increase the performance of the classifier in [9], while the deep+shallow syntactic- and lexical-feature based classifier in [7] showed a poor performance when the set of lexical features is limited. Neither of these has however studied how much performance can be obtained by using only deep syntactic features. The closest to our work is [8] which compares the performance of an interaction extraction system using only lexical features versus using syntactic (both shallow and deep) features. We highlight the difference with our work at the end of Section \'Related Work\'. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, we perform an extensive evaluation of a recently published SVM-based approach [6], which was evaluated only on the LLL data set before, on 5 data sets (AIMed [11], BioInfer [12], HPRD50 [3], LLL [13] and IEPA [14]) using cross-validation as well as 10 cross-data set experiments. Secondly, we compare this approach with stripped down versions which take into account different feature subsets, and we demonstrate that omitting lexical and part of the syntactic features does not significantly change the performance of the relation extraction task. In the remainder of this paper, we first formalize the protein interaction extraction problem as a classification task (Section \'Problem Statement\') in which sentences containing protein pairs are represented by dependency trees (Section \'Interaction Representation\'). In Section \'Building a classifier\', we present the various classifiers that we use in this paper, all of them modifications of [6], and in Section \'Related Work\' we clarify the relationship with related methodologies. We continue with a description of our experimental setup and present the results on the different data sets in Section \'Results and Discussion\'. Our final conclusions are presented in Section \'Conclusion\'. Methods Problem statement Whereas the general interaction extraction task is concerned with finding all interactions among proteins in a given text, several assumptions are usually made to simplify it. The first assumption is that the extraction task is restricted to binary interactions, i.e., exactly two proteins are involved in the interaction. Secondly, the interaction is assumed to be fully expressed in one sentence, i.e., interactions which are described across several sentences are not considered. Finally, the interaction extraction task is evaluated separately from the protein name recognition task. Named entity recognition (NER) is another area of text mining, which is usually performed and evaluated separately, thus it is generally assumed that interaction extraction is performed on a text with annotated protein names ([2,3,5,15]). Let us consider the following sentence containing 4 protein names. Example 1: \"In the shaA1 mutant, sigma(H)2-dependent expression of spo0A3 and spoVG4 at an early stage of sporulation was sensitive to external NaCl.\" This sentence contains 6 protein pairs, namely shaA-sigma(H), shaA-spo0A, shaA-spoVG, sigma(H)-spo0A, sigma(H)-spoVG, and spo0A-spoVG. A protein pair is a positive instance if the original sentence expresses an interaction between members of this pair, and a negative instance if they just co-occur in the sentence. In the example above, there are two positive instances, namely sigma(H)-spo0A and sigma(H)-spoVG while the other 4 instances are negative. As such, the task of protein interaction extraction can be treated as a classification problem, to be solved by learning a suitable decision function that can separate the positive from the negative instances. In particular, we need to choose a formal protein pair representation and a machine learning algorithm. The protein pair representation should include information from the sentence that can be used to distinguish between positive and negative instances. Different approaches use different types of information (features), depending on the machine learning methods used, the available tools and the researcher\'s strategy. Although feature selection for interaction extraction has received little attention [16], several researchers [8,17] report that applying feature selection techniques significantly speeds up the processing and in some cases increases the performance of the classifier. The difference between the feature selection problem and the current approach is explained in detail in Section \'Related Work\'. Interaction representation A dependency tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence. The nodes of the tree are the words of the sentence, and the edges represent the dependencies between words. In a typed dependency tree, edges are labeled with syntactic roles. The dependency tree for the following sentence is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Dependency tree for the sentence from Example 1. Figure 1 represents the dependency tree for the following sentence: \"Sigma F1 activity regulates the processing of sigma E2 within the mother cell compartment.\" Example 2: \"Sigma F1 activity regulates the processing of sigma E2 within the mother cell compartment.\" The most relevant part of the dependency tree to collect information about the relation between the two proteins is the subtree corresponding to the shortest path between these proteins, which is shown in Figure 2a. Both protein names are replaced with dummy strings NE1 and NE2 in order to generalize the interaction pattern. Moreover, we introduce a POS dependency tree, where nodes represent part-of-speech information instead of the corresponding words. The shortest path between the two proteins in the POS dependency tree for Example 2 is represented in 2b. Note that a dependency tree contains lexical as well as deep syntactic information, while a POS dependency tree contains shallow and deep syntactic information. We can obtain a syntactic shortest path by only retaining the syntactic roles in either the shortest path or the POS shortest path, as shown in Figure 2c. Figure 3 depicts similar information for the sentence from Example 1. Figure 2. Shortest path dependency trees for the protein pair in the sentence from Example 2. Figure 2a represents the shortest path between the two proteins in the dependency tree for the sentence: \"Sigma F1 activity regulates the processing of sigma E2 within the mother cell compartment.\" Figures 2b and 2c represent respectively the corresponding POS shortest path and the syntactic path. Note that 2a contains lexical and deep syntactic information, while 2b contains shallow and deep syntactic information, and 2c contains only deep syntactic information. Figure 3. Shortest path dependency trees for one of the protein pairs in the sentence from Example 1. Figure 3 depicts the shortest path dependency trees for the protein pair sigma(H)-spo0A built from the dependency tree of the sentence: \"In the shaA1 mutant, sigma(H)2-dependent expression of spo0A3 and spoVG4 at an early stage of sporulation was sensitive to external NaCl.\" In the remainder we keep referring to these paths as (shortest path) dependency trees. Such a dependency tree can be either a lexical dependency tree (like Figure 2a or 3a), a POS dependency tree (like Figure 2b or 3b) or a syntactic dependency tree (like Figure 2c or 3c). We will use t = (N, E, L) to denote a dependency tree t consisting of a set of nodes N, a set of edges E, and a function L that maps nodes and edges to their labels. If there is an edge from node n1 to node n2, we denote this edge by e(n1, n2). Building a classifier Our feature impact study makes use of a support vector machine (SVM) approach. SVM\'s are a classification method that views input data as vectors in a high-dimensional space and attempts to induce a maximum margin hyperplane between training data points that belong to different classes. The crucial point is that the hyperplane can be represented as a linear combination of a subset of training instances (support vectors) [18]. Moreover, the selection of the appropriate support vectors can be done by using only the inner product between training examples. Hence, if the inner product can be computed efficiently, SVM\'s can induce a classifier even in a very rich feature space. In order to deal with various kinds of input data, different strategies to compute inner products (referred to as kernels) have been proposed (see e.g. [19]). In order to build a syntactic kernel, the dependency tree space has to be kernelized. Each data point of our data set is a dependency tree corresponding to a part of the sentence in which the protein pair occurs. Such a tree can be represented as a vector in the m-dimensional space made up by all subtrees in the data set [20]. More in particular, assuming that all unique subtrees in the data set are enumerated from 1 to m, the function hs(t), s ? {1,...,m}, is defined as the number of occurrences of subtree s in tree t. Then, each tree t can be represented by a vector ? (t) = {h1(t), h2(t),...,hm(t)}. A kernel function measuring the similarity between trees t1 and t2 based on whether they contain the same subtrees, is defined as the inner product (1) The underlying vector representation is very rich since the number of subtrees of a tree grows exponentially with the tree size, which makes the computation of the inner product intractable. However, the right hand side of (1) can be interpreted as the number of common subtrees of t1 and t2, and can be computed efficiently following a procedure proposed in [20]. Kim et al. [6] follow this procedure in developing an SVM classifier based on a kernel KFULL that is a combination of a kernel KLEX comparing lexical dependency trees, with a kernel KPOS comparing POS dependency trees. Note that, because of their construction, KLEX relies on lexical and deep syntactic information, while KPOS is based on shallow and deep syntactic features. We propose a way in which the kernel KFULL can be stripped down to a kernel KS, that uses only deep syntactic features. We compare the performance of all these kernels in Section \'Results and Discussion\'. For ease of explanation, in this section we follow a bottom-up approach by first defining KS, and then extending it to the full system from [6]. The trees from Figures 2a and 3a have no subtrees in common, while when we switch to a shallow or pure syntactic representation in Figures 2b,c and 3b,c, we have one common fragment, namely the subtree consisting only of the edge prep_of and its adjacent nodes. In general, we use a recursive formula to compute the number of common subtrees between dependency trees t1 and t2. This formula relies on the notion of common child pairs of node n1 in t1 and node n2 in t2, i.e. the set of pairs of nodes that have parents n1 and n2 respectively, and that are connected to these parents by the same type of edge. When traversing down the trees in search of common subtrees, these are the nodes at which we want to continue our exploration. Definition 1. Let t1 = (N1, E1, L1) and t2 = (N2, E2, L2) be dependency trees. For n1 ? N1 and n2 ? N2, the set of common child pairs is defined as Com(n1, n2) = {(x, y)| (x, y) ? N1 × N2, e(n1, x) ? E1, e(n2, y) ? E2, L1(e(n1, x)) = L2(e(n2, y))}. Definition 2. Let t1 = (N1, E1, L1) and t2 = (N2, E2, L2) be dependency trees. For n1 ? N1 and n2 ? N2, the number of common subtrees rooted at n1 and n2 is defined as The recursive formula reflects the fact that a new common subtree rooted at n1 and n2 can be found either by picking 1 of the Cm(x, y) subtrees or by adding the x/y nodes, or just by staying as is (therefore +2). 1 is subtracted from the whole result to exclude the combination with the tree consisting of the n1/n2 node only. Example 3. Let t1 and t2 be the dependency trees from Figure 2a and 3a respectively. Com(n1, n2) is the empty set for all node pairs with exception of Com(processing, expression) = {(NE2, NE2)}. Hence Cm(processing, expression) = (Cm(NE2, NE2) + 2) -1 = 1 while Cm(n1, n2) = 0 for all other node pairs. This means that there is only one common subtree between t1 and t2, rooted at the processing, expression nodes and ending at NE2. Note that the calculation above of the number of common subtrees disregards node labels, i.e., it treats dependency trees as they are shown in Figure 2c and Figure 3c. Using Definition 2 we are now able to define a kernel KS that looks only at deep syntactic information. It computes the similarity between syntactic dependency trees as the number of grammatical structures that they have in common. Definition 3. The kernel function KS is defined as (2) for syntactic dependency trees t1 and t2. Example 4. Let t1 and t2 be the syntactic dependency trees from Figure 2c and Figure 3c respectively. Since |N1| = 5 and |N2| = 3, the summation in the right hand side of (2) consists of 15 terms. In Example 3 we already established that all of these terms are 0 with the exception of one term that equals 1. Hence KS(t1, t2) = 1. To arrive at kernels that take into account additional lexical and/or shallow syntactic information, we need an extended version of Definition 1 that also looks at the labels of nodes. Definition 4. Let t1 = (N1, E1, L1) and t2 = (N2, E2, L2) be dependency trees. For n1 ? N1 and n2 ? N2, the set of common child pairs, taking into account the labels of the nodes, is defined as Comlab(n1, n2) = {(x, y)|(x, y) ? Com(n1, n2), L1(n1) = L2(n2), L1(x) = L2(y)}. The superscript \"lab\" refers to the fact that the labels of the nodes are taken into account. The appearance of Com(n1, n2) in the definition of Comlab(n1, n2) illustrates that the latter builds on the former. Furthermore, it holds that indicating that using syntactic trees leads to a more general approach (more nodes are explored when traversing down the trees in search for common subtrees). The number Cmlab(n1, n2) of common subtrees rooted at n1 and n2, can now be defined in a recursive manner entirely analogous to Definition 2, however relying on Comlab(n1, n2) instead of on Com(n1, n2). Since they have different labels at the nodes, the value of Cmlab(n1, n2) might be different depending on whether a lexical dependency tree or a POS dependency tree is used. In both cases, it holds however that (3) Example 5. Let t1 and t2 be the lexical dependency trees from Figure 2a and Figure 3a respectively. For all node pairs it holds that Comlab(n1, n2) = ?, and Cmlab(n1, n2) = 0. Example 6. Let t1 and t2 be the POS dependency trees from Figure 2b and Figure 3b respectively. It holds that Comlab(NN, NN) = {(NE2, NE2)} and Cmlab(NN, NN) = 1, while for all other node pairs Comlab(n1, n2) = ? and Cmlab(n1, n2) = 0. The potentially different behavior of Cmlab(n1, n2) on lexical dependency trees and POS dependency trees gives rise to the definitions of the kernel functions KLEX and KPOS respectively. Both of them still consider the tree structure when computing the similarity between trees, i.e. they both rely on deep syntactic information. In addition, KLEX takes the actual words of the sentence into account (lexical information) while KPOS considers POS (shallow syntactic information). Definition 5. [20] The kernel function KLEX is defined as (4) for lexical dependency trees t1 and t2. In our case function L maps words in the tree nodes to corresponding lemmas eliminating the differences arising from different word forms. Definition 6. [6] The kernel function KPOS is defined as for POS dependency trees t1 and t2. Finally, Kim et al. [6] combine KLEX and KPOS into a kernel KFULL that takes into account lexical, shallow and deep syntactic information. Definition 7. [6] The kernel KFULL is defined as (5) for dependency trees t1 and t2 and their corresponding POS dependency trees and . Notice that KLEX is a refinement of KS in the sense that all the information used by KS is also used in the same way by KLEX. As a consequence, KFULL is also a refinement of KS, enriching the deep syntactic information of KS by lexical information (through KLEX) as well as shallow syntactic information (through KPOS). Example 7. Let t1 and t2 be the lexical dependency trees from Figure 2a and Figure 3a respectively, and and their corresponding POS dependency trees from Figure 2b and Figure 3b respectively. One can verify that and hence KFULL(t1, t2) = 1. Notice that although the trees do not show any resemblance on the lexical level, their similarity at the more general syntactic level is picked up by KPOS. In Example 4 we found that their syntactic similarity is also already reflected by KS. A short summary of the kernels described above is provided in Table 1. Table 1. Kernels Related work In Table 2, an overview of recent approaches to interaction extraction is presented along with the characteristics that are relevant in the context of our work. Below we describe these approaches in more detail. Table 2. General approaches for protein interaction extraction Many approaches exploit the idea of using explicit feature vectors to represent a possible interaction. In particular, approaches based on various combinations of lexical features are very popular in the relation extraction community. Bunescu et al. [2] propose to use the sentence context, obtained by splitting a sentence into three parts, i.e. before the first protein, between the two proteins, and after the second protein, and they combine them in predefined ways to obtain 3 types of patterns. Using this information, the authors propose a kernel that naturally emerges from the subsequence kernel described in [21] and obtain good results on the AIMed corpus. Giuliano et al. [4] start from the same pattern types, but treat them as bags-of-words, and define a global context kernel. Moreover, they define a local context kernel by taking a window of predefined size around the candidate proteins and adding more shallow linguistic information, such as the lemma of the word and some orthographic features. The resulting kernel function in this case is a linear combination of the global context kernel and the local context kernel. Their method obtains state-of-the-art results on the AIMed and LLL data sets. Some researchers focus on sentence structure, i.e., on the parse and dependency tree, to construct a feature vector. Xiao et al. [9] study the impact of features, starting with simple words up to parse and dependency trees on the IEPA corpus, and they obtain a remarkable 90.9% F-score using a maximum entropy model with lexical and shallow syntactic features. Yakushiji et al. [10] suggest that full parsing information could be very useful in the biology domain because the distance between entities in a sentence can be much longer than in general-purpose domains. Therefore, they propose a method that builds complex predicate-argument structures (PAS), and apply an SVM with an RBF kernel to these patterns to obtain a classifier model. They evaluate this model on the AIMed data set and obtain a 57.3% F-score. In [5], the authors also focus on sentence structure and use dependency trees to extract the local contexts of the protein names, the root verbs of the sentence, and the parent of the protein nodes in the dependency tree. Classification is further done by BayesNet and ensemble classifiers. Another approach is proposed in [3], where a manually constructed set of rules uses information from the dependency trees and a predefined vocabulary to classify possible interaction instances. This approach is evaluated on the HPRD50 and LLL data sets, as well as on a large-scale data set consisting of 1 million MEDLINE abstracts. The extracted set of interactions contained 40% of the HPRD interaction database. In our own previous work [15], we proposed to abstract from lexical features and use only syntactic information to obtain a more general classifier that would be suitable for different data sets without retraining. We used features extracted from dependency and parse trees to build decision trees and BayesNet classifiers, and obtained promising results using AIMed as test data and LLL as training data. Another group of approaches does not rely on an explicit feature vector but rather makes use of structured data as input information for the classifier. This means that structured features, such as dependency trees, can be used as an input to the classifier without any additional transformations, thus reducing the risk of losing useful information. One particular way to use structured features that we adhere to in the current paper, is to exploit structured kernels. The approaches [1,6,7] are closest to our work as they also use structured kernels. Structured or convolution kernels were introduced in [22] by Haussler who proposed how to compute a kernel for structured objects. This work gave rise to many tree kernel methods in the text mining domain. Although this idea is quite popular in general text mining, it has not been widely explored in the interaction extraction literature. Saetre et al. [7] apply a structured kernel to the protein-protein interaction domain. In this approach, a mix of at and structured features is used to calculate the similarity of two protein pairs. The flat part of the feature vector contains lexical features, while the structured part is a shortest path dependency tree, referred to as a partial tree. This definition was introduced by Moschitti [23] who studied different tree partitioning strategies and their impact on tree kernels for dependency and parse trees. Using these fatures, Saetre et al. obtain promising results on the AIMed data set, especially in combination with a rich lexical feature set. In another very recent approach, described in [1], the authors propose to use the whole dependency tree to build a classifier. They use a graph kernel that takes into account all paths in dependency trees, and exploit it with an RLS (regularized least squares) machine learning method. The experimental evaluation is performed on 5 data sets: AIMed, BioInfer, HPRD50, IEPA and LLL, and for all of them, the method shows remarkably good results. Collins and Duffy [20] developed a tree kernel that counts the number of common subtrees, but used it for parsing and not for interaction extraction. Kim et al. [6] apply this kernel to a dependency tree and to a modified dependency tree with POS instead of words, and propose a combined kernel, which is a sum of these two. This approach obtains state-of-the-art performance on the LLL data set. In the same paper they describe a flat feature vector-based approach that also utilizes dependency trees to extract graph walks as features. In [8], the authors study the relative feature importance for the latter approach by using the gain ratio feature selection technique. Moreover, they study the impact of different feature types as well by comparing the performance of methods that use syntactic features versus methods that use lexical features. Our approach is also based on Kim\'s work, however it is different from [8] in several aspects. First of all, our approach is different from the feature selection task, because we focus on the type of the information (lexical, POS, grammatical relations) rather than on separate features. In other words, we do not use feature selection techniques to discriminate useful individual features, but fit an existing relation extraction method to consider only a subset of features of a certain type, and study the impact of this feature class. Secondly, when we study the impact of different feature types we do not rely on a flat vector, but on a structured representation. Moreover, we use an additional data set and define more extensive experimental setups in order to perform a complete study of different use cases. Results Data sets To the best of our knowledge the only publicly available data sets that contain protein interaction annotations are: AIMed [11], BioInfer [12], HPRD50 [3], LLL [13] and IEPA [14]. These data sets have been frequently used in recent work of for example [1,8,24]; therefore we use them in our current work. Table 3 gives an overview of the number of positive and negative instances in the different data sets. Table 3. Corpora statistics The AImed data set consists of 225 abstracts extracted from the Database of Interaction Proteins (DIP), 200 of which contain annotated human gene and protein interactions. Another 25 abstracts contain protein names but do not describe any interactions. We have used only the former set of abstracts for our evaluation purposes. The BioInfer data set is the largest data set among these 5; it contains 1100 sentences describing protein-protein interactions. Beside the interaction annotations, BioInfer contains additional information about biological interaction type, protein roles in interaction, syntactic dependencies between words, etc. Moreover, there is a knowledge base behind the corpus, which allows to analyse it in more detail (see [12]). HPRD50 contains sentences that were extracted from a subset of 50 abstracts, referenced by the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and annotated with protein names and interactions between them. The LLL data set consists of 76 sentences describing interactions concerning Bacillus subtilis transcription. Protein roles for interactions are annotated along with the interactions themselves. Additionally, the data set contains annotations for lemmas and syntactic dependencies between the words in the sentences. Finally, The IEPA data set was built by querying Medline with 10 diverse queries, reflecting 10 different biological topics. 303 abstracts were retrieved, and a data set was constructed with sentences extracted from these abstracts. The data set annotation includes an interacting verb along with the protein names and interactions. The BioInfer and LLL data sets provide syntactic dependencies for every sentence in their own formats, while the other data sets do not provide this information. We discarded this information to unify the setup and to make the experiment more realistic. Besides being non-standard, some of the syntactic information in BioInfer and LLL was obtained manually which violates the requirements of automatic processing. To obtain POS and dependency trees for all data sets we used the Stanford parser [25] trained on general purpose corpora. We choose this parser because of its peculiar annotation scheme that stresses the semantic connections between words rather than operating on the purely syntactic level. For example, prepositions are collapsed as can be seen in Figure 2a, where the noun processing is being connected directly to a protein name. As we use a dependency tree representation to obtain all three types of features, we do not use an external POS tagger to obtain POS tags separately; instead they are assigned as part of the dependency tree building process inside the Stanford parser. As the Stanford parser does not provide lemmatized versions of words, we used the Porter Stemmer algorithm [26] to compute KLEX and KFULL. All data sets use different annotation schemes that emphasize different interaction properties. For example, in AIMed homodimeric proteins are being annotated, i.e. proteins that interact with themselves, while the current mining approach is not able to detect such cases. Moreover, in BioInfer some proteins have gaps in annotations, i.e. there is a gap between two parts of one protein name. We handle these cases separately, but they can potentially decrease the performance of the classifier as well. The quality of the annotation itself (measured as e.g. inter-annotator agreement) may affect the quality of classifier. If an annotator misses an interaction between two proteins, the data point related to this protein pair would be treated as a negative instance, although containing an interaction pattern, which is harmful to the overall performance. To unify an experimental setup, we need to cast all corpora to a common ground format. Pyysalo et al. [27] designed custom software that converts all 5 data sets to a single XML format that contains only minimal protein and interaction annotations, which is sufficient for our evaluation purposes. However, not all annotation differences can be eliminated in this way. Table 3 shows that different data sets have very different positive/negative ratios. This can be partially explained by different annotation strategies, e.g. for LLL only proteins that are involved in interactions are annotated, while for other data sets all protein names are annotated. Since we consider every possible protein pair within a sentence to be an instance, this leads to an exponential growth of the total number of instances, while in fact the number of positive instances remains the same. Taking into account this information, we should choose our evaluation metrics carefully in order to provide a fair comparison of the performance on all data sets. Performance metrics In this work, we use two evaluation metrics, namely recall-precision and ROC (reciever operating characteristic) curves, to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the achieved results. Let us first recall their definitions. Let TP denote the number of true positives, i.e., the number of positive instances that are classified as such, let FP denote the number of false positives, i.e., the number of negative instances that are incorrectly classified as positive, and analogously, let TN and FN stand for the number of true negatives and false negatives respectively. The following metrics can then be defined: Recall stands for the fraction of correctly classified instances (TP) among all positive instances (TP+FN) in a data set, while precision denotes the fraction of correctly classified instances (TP) among all instances that are classified as positive (TP+FP). Recall is sometimes called true positive rate, while false positive rate counts how many of the negative instances were wrongly classified as positive. A combined measure, that takes into account both recall and precision is called F-score and defined as: Often, a classifier\'s output can be ordered, i.e. the classifier also provides a degree of confidence for each prediction it makes. In this case, we can trade precision for a higher recall by lowering the confidence threshold to capture more positive instances. In this way we can build a recall-precision curve that shows the relationship between the quality of extracted relations (precision) and the amount of extracted relations (recall). The closer to the top-right corner a curve is, the less precision is lost with recall growth and the better the performance of the classifier is. Precision, recall and F-score are de-facto standards for the interaction extraction evaluation. However, these metrics are very sensitive to data set skewedness, i.e., the large difference between the number of positive and negative instances. As was shown in Table 3, this difference varies greatly for different corpora. On the other hand, ROC curves are being used in the machine learning community to evaluate classifier performance and they do not depend on data set skewedness. The false positive rate together with the true positive rate correspond to a point in ROC space. By varying the trade-off between these two metrics we obtain a curve in ROC space. The AUC-score is the area under this ROC-curve. It can be interpreted as the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance. However, this metric should be used carefully for the same reason, i.e. it is suitable to evaluate the relative quality of a classifier (percentage of extracted positive instances), but it gives no information about precision, and thus makes the evaluation of a classifier difficult. For example, if we increase the number of negatives 10 times, then the number of FP on average increases 10 times as well. This will lead to a significant drop in precision and consequently in F-score, but it does not influence the false positive rate. Based on this observation, we can outline an application area for both evaluation metrics. The ROC curve and the corresponding AUC value should be used to compare the performance of a classifier on different corpora, since they show the relative number of extracted positive instances. Recall-precision and F-score can be used to compare the quality of several classifiers on the same data set, since they indicate how \'clean\' the classification is without regarding the proportion of negative instances. Experimental setup For the experiments, we used the LIBSVM library [28] to build the 4 SVM classifiers that use the KFULL kernel, KPOS kernel, KS kernel and KLEX kernel. Furthermore, we organized 3 experimental setups. The first setup uses 10-fold cross-validation (CV), where each data set is split into 10 parts, of which 9 are used for training and one for testing. Despite the fact that this is the most common way of evaluation, it should be used carefully. Since we work on instance level, it can be the case that two nearly identical instances from the same sentence fall into a train and a test fold at the same time. This \'leak\' can cause a performance boost as it was shown in [7,8]. In the second setup (4-1) we join 4 data sets to form a training set, and use the remaining one as a test set. Compared to CV, this alternative experimental setup is closer to a real world situation where information for processing is obtained from different sources and the lexicon is not as uniform as in one precompiled data set. In the last setup (1-4) we use 1 data set as training set and the remaining 4 as test sets, thus making another step to the real world. Typically, biologists have a very limited amount of annotated data compared to the size of available unlabeled information. We try to model this situation here by making the training set much smaller than the test set. For each experimental setup we run all classifiers with all data set combinations. An analysis of the results obtained is provided in the following section. Discussion Table 4 and Figures 4, 5, 6, 7 give an overview of the evaluation results for all experimental setups. In line with our evaluation metric review, we use recall-precision and ROC curves to analyze the obtained experimental results. On the basis of these results, we can make the interesting observation that the different kernels are roughly comparable, while the amount of information they use is very different. In the analysis below we will omit the +syntactic postfix when talking about the lexical+syntactic (KLEX), shallow+syntactic (KPOS) and lexical+shallow+syntactic (KFULL) kernels. Table 4.

Figure 7 depicts ROC curves for different kernels. From left top to right bottom: lexical kernel, Lexical+Shallow kernel, shallow kernel, syntactic kernel. Precision plays a particularly important role in the interaction extraction task, because if the extracted information is processed by a biologist, she would not like the system if it produces too much rubbish. Therefore, we are particularly interested in the left side of the recall-precision chart, where precision is typically high, although recall may be quite low. Table 4 shows the F-measure results calculated for classifier confidence threshold 0.5, as well as the AUC values which are not dependent on any threshold. Let us note that the F-measure values could be tuned up, because on most recall-precision charts precision does not drop significantly after a certain point, while recall keeps growing. However, this is not the aim of the current research, thus we leave the task of looking for the optimal operation point aside. Table 5 sums up our empirical observations over recall-precision curves provided in Figures 4, 5, 6, particularly on the area before 0.2-0.3 recall values. For example, Figure 4d clearly shows that lexical kernel performs best for the recall up to approximately 0.18 in this experimental setting. Using these empirical observations we fill Table 5. The table gives some insight on how different types of information affect the performance of the relation extraction system. Note that these observations are different from Table 4, because typically a 0.5 threshold covers more than 30% of recall. Below we provide a more detailed analysis of the results shown in Table 4 and in Figures 4, 5, 6. Table 5. Information types The cross-validation setup reveals no clear leader for all data sets. For the LLL data set, the syntactic kernel shows the best performance (Figure 4a). That can be explained by the fact that the LLL data set is very small and contains relatively short hand-picked sentences with a simple syntactic structure. However, experiments with other data sets show that the lexical kernel gives the best results for the HPRD50 and BioInfer data sets (Figures 5b and 4b). In the case of BioInfer, this can be explained by the fact that the training set size is large enough to discriminate useful lexical features. For IEPA, the full kernel, i.e. lexical+shallow, performs best, while the lexical kernel shows the worst result (Figure 5a), and for the AIMed data set the syntactic kernel shows better results for small recall values (Figure 6a). The predictive power of deep syntactic features by themselves is very interesting, given that the lexical and lexical+shallow methods in theory can take additional advantage of the lexicon similarity within the same data set that is caused by the nature of the cross-validation set up. When we train on 4 data sets and test on 1, the lexical+shallow kernel is among the best for all but the BioInfer data set. Figure 4d shows that the lexical kernel outperforms the others on BioInfer for small recall values. A significantly better performance of the lexical kernel for small recall values can be interpreted as a sign of overfitting, i.e. a classifier with a lexical kernel produces too specific patterns, which causes a successful classification of several instances, but is followed by a significant precision drop due to the unability to generalize over less frequent cases. On the other hand, other classifiers avoid overfitting and a steep precision drop, but at the cost of missing some very reliable patterns. Moreover, the lexical kernel shows a performance similar to the lexical+shallow kernel for HPRD50 and AIMed (Figures 5d and 6b), but fails on IEPA (Figure 5c). On the other hand, the syntactic kernel performs good on the IEPA and LLL data sets (Figures 5c and 4c), but is not that good on others. Although with the 1-4 experimental setup there is no best kernel either, we can still observe some interesting patterns. The lexical kernel shows a significantly better performance on the AIMed and HPRD50 data set for small recall values (Figures 6c and 5f), while the syntactic kernel performs best for the LLL and IEPA data sets on the whole curve (Figures 4c and 5e). As it is shown on Figure 4e, training the classifier on LLL causes extreme curve shapes caused by the significant difference in size between the training set and the test data set. The first instances for the lexical+shallow and the shallow kernels were classified correctly, but further precision drops dramatically. After 0.25 recall value, the lexical kernel basically neglects all positive instances, and the curve shows simply the percentage of positive instances in the data set. Other kernels perform slightly better and the syntactic kernel is able to consistently outperform others. This can be explained by the fact that 80 sentences (the size of the LLL data set) is definitely not enough to train a classifier. Moreover, it shows that in the case of training information shortage the syntactic kernel can offer a better solution than others. The last two experiments illustrate the case when the vocabulary of train and test data sets differ, which is often the case in the real world. In the former case the training set is large enough to successfully train the lexical+shallow kernel, making the difference in the vocabularies not so crucial. However, in the latter case, when the training set is much smaller than the test set (train on LLL case on Figure 4e) we can clearly see the influence of this fact on the performance difference between syntactic and lexical methods. From the experiments above we can observe the following trends: • lexical and combined methods are able to build better generalizations (due to large amount of available lexical data) and thus perform better with large (relative to test) training sets • syntactic methods are able to achieve better results than lexical ones when the training set is small in comparison with the test set Moreover, there seems to be a correlation between better performing kernels and data sets. For example, the syntactic kernel always obtains good results on the LLL and IEPA data sets, while the lexical+shallow kernel performs well for the BioInfer data set. Moreover, the lexical kernel is always on top for the HPRD50 data set. These observations show that the data set origin and properties (such as annotation strategy, average sentence complexity) have a strong influence on classifier performance. Compiling ROC curves for one method on one chart allows us to analyze the robustness of this method on different data sets. In Figure 7 each chart displays ROC curves for one method for all experimental setups. The less spread the curves are in the ROC space, the more predictable the performance of the method is. In most cases, the LLL cross-validation setup is out of the trend, because of its small size and density. Otherwise, the shallow (Figure 7c) and syntactic (Figure 7a) kernels exhibit more or less coherent behavior for all setups for the given data sets. The lexical+shallow kernel (Figure 7d) shows some spread, but again mostly due to the LLL data set\'s based setups, and the lexical kernel (Figure 7b) proves to be the most unpredictable. Conclusion In this paper we examined different structured kernels with SVM\'s to study the impact of different features on the relation extraction process. We took four kernels that reflect different degrees of using syntactic and lexical information and performed three types of experiments to study the behaviour of these methods under different conditions. We performed our experiments on five benchmark data sets, being AIMed, BioInfer, IEPA, HPRD50 and LLL. The most important observation is that by using only grammatical relations (syntactic kernel) we can obtain a similar performance as with an extended feature set (lexical kernel). This indicates the relative importance of grammatical information for the interaction extraction task. Another finding is the correlation between training/test set sizes and the method choice. We observed that when the training set is much smaller than the test set, then the syntactic kernel performs better. This might be explained by the fact that there are too few instances to induce useful lexical features, whereas syntactic features require less instances to produce better results. When the training set grows, the performance of the full kernel becomes better, and when the training data set is larger than the test set (which rarely happens in real life), the full kernel outperforms all other kernels. From the stability point of view (i.e., the expected performance on unseen data), we can conclude that the syntactic kernel provides the best results, whereas the lexical kernel provides the worst results. The question of how different features within one feature type affect the quality of classification still remains open and represents an interesting direction for future work. We believe that these findings can be helpful in building faster and less complicated classifiers, as well as for choosing a proper kernel according to the data set at hand.

The winning teams were announced at KDD 2013, the 19th annual conference of ACM SIGKDD (the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) which took place in Chicago in August. KDD is the premier event for researchers grappling with today’s data deluge, as it’s the only conference spanning big data, data mining, data science, and analytics and all the related algorithms, foundations, applications, and practices. 2013 KDD Cup challenge winners, Team Algorithm, from National Taiwan University The 2013 KDD Cup challenge focused on the ability to search literature and to collect metrics around publications—a capability that is essential to modern research, as academic and industry researchers increasingly rely on search to discover what has been published and by whom. The competition made use of a data set of 250,000 authors and 2.5 million published papers. The dataset was broken up into a distinct labeled training set, a validation set for the leaderboard, and a test set. The competitors faced two tasks: first, a prediction task to determine whether an author had written a paper, and second, a name disambiguation task to identify duplicate author names in a dataset with name variants. These tasks go to the heart of one of the main challenges of information extraction and curation in any people-centric dataset: resolving people-name ambiguity. In the scholarly publishing world, many authors publish under several variations of their own name, and to add to the complexity of discovery, different authors might share a similar or even the same name. As a result, the profile of an author with an ambiguous name tends to contain noise, resulting in papers that are incorrectly assigned to him or her. The KDD Cup task challenged participants to determine which papers in an author profile were truly written by a given author. Read the full parameters of the challenge. The competition was fierce, with more than 800 teams from more than 40 different countries developing approximately 12,000 data-mining models over the course of a few months. The winning solution, created by Professor Chih-Jen Lin and Team Algorithm from National Taiwan University, was the product of outstanding teamwork: eighteen students and three teaching assistants actually designed a graduate course around the competition. Other winners included teams from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Moscow State University, and FICO. Winners presented their solutions at a KDD Cup workshop and poster session at the conference. Moreover, solutions created for the competition resulted in 10 research papers that are available through the KDD Cup 2013 Workshop proceedings. KDD Cup poster session participants at KDD 2013 On behalf of Microsoft Research Connections, I would like to thank the key collaborators who helped make this competition a success. The Microsoft Research Connections proposal for the KDD Cup challenge was selected after careful deliberation by 2013 KDD Cup chairpersons Claudia Perlich and Brian Dalessandro of Media6°. Partnering with me in designing the contest rules and evaluation criteria were Professors Martine DeCock of Ghent University and Senjuti Basu Roy of the University of Washington Tacoma, along with Ben Hamner and Will Cukierski of Kaggle. Swapna Savvana and Yitao Li from the University of Washington Tacoma helped with the logistics of the contest execution. So congrats to the KDD Cup winners, and kudos to everyone who accepted the challenge. The many outstanding solutions showed great creativity, which is exactly what we’ll need as we move forward in this new world of data-intensive scientific inquiry. —Vani Mandava, Senior Program Manager, Microsoft Research Connections Learn more KDD (Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) KDD 2013 proceedings ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Education and Scholarly Communication at Microsoft Research Connections 0 Comments Chicago, scholarly communication, algorithms, Moscow State University, Data mining, data, big data, data science, analytics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, publication metrics, Association of Computing Machinery, Will Cukierski, information extraction, curation, Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Team Algorithm, FICO, Swapna Savvana, Vani Mandava, Prof. Chih-Jen Lin, scholarly publishing, Ben Hamner, 2013 KDD Cup challenge, National Taiwan University, Yitao Li, Microsoft Research Connections KDD 2013 ACM SIGKDD, Senjuti Basu Roy, Martine DeCock Leave a Comment Name Comment Please add 5 and 2 and type the answer here: Post Publishing An error occurred while posting!

Recent Events Please join us in congratulating Yiru Li, Sarah George, Craig Apfelbeck, Abdeltawab Hendawi, David Hazel, Ankur Teredesai and Mohamed Ali on winning the \"Best Demo\" award at the ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS Conference 2014  on the iTornado system. The paper is titled: “Routing Service With Real World Severe Weather” and presents a framework for routing services to evacuate vehicles under real world severe weather threats. The system is able to: (1) Identify the users inside the dangerous region of a severe weather event, (2) Recommend an evacuation route to guide the users out to a safe destination or shelter, (3) Assure the recommended route to be one of the shortest paths after excluding the risky area, and  (4) Maintain the flow of traffic by normalizing the evacuation on the possible safe routes. For additional information, please visit the Geospatial Data Management page of the Center for Data Science: http://cwds.uw.edu/geospatial-data-management” Dr. George Mobus, Associate Professor in Computer Science & Systems and Computer Engineering & Systems, has just had his textbook (along with co-author Professor Emeritus Michael Kalton of IAS) entitled Principles of Systems Science published by Springer, New York. This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. The book contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. Please join us in congratulating Dr. Mobus on this major accomplishment.

U.S. EPA Senior Policy Advisor visits Urban Waters Dr. Ellen Gilinksy - Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of Water, U.S. EPA, Washington D.C. - visited the Center for Urban Waters on June 5, 2014. With Data and Resolve, Tacoma Fights Pollution Last year, environmental engineers working for this city had an unnerving worry. After a decade and tens of millions of dollars devoted to a fastidious cleanup of its corner of Puget Sound, Tacoma’s shore front was in danger of being contaminated with a highly toxic chemical. Working their way upstream, the engineers discovered the source of the problem: a storm drain in a residential neighborhood. Black goo stuck to its sides was old grout that contained large concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Used in local road building in 1975, PCBs, odorless and carcinogenic, were outlawed soon thereafter. Yet they were swept up and sent mostly through drain pipes on their way to Puget Sound. Tacoma Rain Gardens Cleaning Contaminants in Thea Foss Waterway Deemed a Superfund site in 1983, the City of Tacoma is now making headway to clean up the contaminated Thea Foss Waterway. The city has been monitoring high levels of chemicals like arsenic and pesticides for 12 years, and recent tests show a decrease in 90 percent of contaminants. Better known for its lights and sounds inside, Dorky\'s Arcade in Tacoma is now getting attention for its efforts outside. Owner Les Vorosbond sponsors one of the city\'s rain gardens. The City of Tacoma has 14 rain gardens, but sponsors only four. Coordinators hope businesses and organizations will chip in and help. Cleaning Urban Waters Using Collaboration and Science Coordinating government agencies, universities, community leaders, and local businesses has led to successful and real-world clean water methods for Tacoma, Washington. 2014 PNW-SETAC 23rd Annual Conference The Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry:Promoting toxicology and chemistry research in the Pacific Northwest - will hold their annual 3-day conference on April 24-26, 2014 in Tacoma, Washington. Staff representing the Center for Urban Waters, City of Tacoma, and University of Washington-Tacoma will be among the many experts presenting at this year\'s conference. Source Control Investigation Leads to Identification of a PCB Source Sediment trap monitoring in the OF237B drainage basin showed intermittent relatively elevated levels of PCBs in two upstream sediment traps. These sediment traps are located in a primarily residential area of East Tacoma. Additional Improvement Found in Stormwater Quality in the Thea Foss Drainage Basin Annual comprehensive stormwater monitoring by the City of Tacoma shows additional improvement in stormwater quality in the Thea Foss drainage basin. Results from Year 7 Thea Foss Waterway Monitoring Appear Promising The City completed Year 7 post-remediation monitoring of the sediments in the Thea Foss and Wheeler-Osgood Waterways, and submitted an annual report summarizing the results to EPA for review in November. Monitoring included sediment chemistry, hydrographic survey, low tide visual monitoring, sediment profile imaging, groundwater monitoring and habitat evaluation.

Prakash B.S., Environmental Science, 2009 Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids in the Puget Sound   Shristi is currently investigating Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids (PFCAs) which are synthetic chemicals applied in carpet, paper and textile industries to render products water and oil repellant. She will be collecting and testing water samples from various locations around the Puget Sound for various chain lengths of PFCAs. These compounds are also used as processing aids in the production of fluoropolymers typically used as non-stick coatings in items such as pots and pans.  PFCAs are characterized by a carboxylic end-group and hydrophobic perfluorinated chain of various lengths. The widespread detection and bioaccumulation of PFCAs in the environment is of increasing concern. Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) the 8 carbon version of PFCAs has been detected in various environmental samples including sediment, biota, ground and surface waters as well as human serum. The potential toxicity of these compounds is also of concern.  This study is important in evaluating all chain lengths of PFCAs since there have been no previous studies examining the presence and concentrations of these emerging class of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Puget Sound.     Student: Portia Leigh BS., Environmental Science, 2009 Fate of Telomer Alcohols in Terrestrial Environments Portia is studying the fate of fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) in terrestrial and plant systems.  FTOHs like many organic chemicals are likely to be found in biosolids resulting from their applications. Soil is a complicated matrix, where organic compounds such as FTOHs typically remain bound.  Extent of binding to soils is a function of the partitioning of these chemicals to organic matter (KOC).  She will be performing experiments using plants native to the Pacific Northweste grown in FTOH spiked soils.  The soil composition that she is using is similar to composition used in rain gardens.  Currently she is developing a method to extract FTOHs from this particular soil type.  Future studies will try to determine plant uptake, loss or biotransformation. Student: Ji Yeam Hydrolysis of Fluorotelomer Monomers Ji is currently investigating the hydrolytic stability of telomer-based monomers as a function of pH and temperature.  He will be testing various chemical linkages tested including ester, ether and urethane linkages. The kinetics and mechanism of hydrolysis as well as identification of products will also be examined.  The hydrolytic stability of these compounds is of importance as they may enter aquatic systems through various routes including urban run off, drainage, waste disposal and industrial effluent. Thus, these compounds may be subjected to hydrolytic reactions that may release fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), compounds found to be precursors to perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCA) such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).  This study is critical in evaluating all potential sources of this emerging class of persistent organic pollutant (POP) in the environment.   Student:  Chris Pyke Water and Sediment Quality Monitoring of First Creek in Tacoma WA: A service learning project in collaboration with City of Tacoma and First Creek Neighbors.

My research interests as an environmental chemist is in investigating what happens to these chemicals as it gets released into the environment. I focus primarily in studying emerging organic pollutants such as Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids (PFCAs), which are chemicals used widely in textile and carpet industries to render products water and dirt repellent. These chemicals have recently been identified as ubiquitous contaminants, found in every environmental matrix studied including various species of wildlife and human blood. These compounds are a concern due to their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate in the environment.                        DINGLASAN-PANLILIO LABORATORY Environmental Organic Chemistry Research at the University of Washington Tacoma         Home Research Publications Courses Students Photos Contact Information     Science Bldg-University of Washington, Tacoma     Contact Information Mailing Address Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences University of Washington, Tacoma 1900 Commerce Street, Campus Box 358436 Tacoma, Washington 98402 Office Science Building 204 Lab Lab Science Building 310 Email jdingpan@u.washington.edu Telephone (253) 693-4823 Fax (253) 692-5718 Click here for C.V.                        Skip to main content Toggle navigation Webmail Portal ROSI Contacts Maps A-Z Index Search U of T for Webmail Portal ROSI Contacts Maps A-Z Index Admissions Programs and Areas Research Campuses Libraries Alumni Giving About President Spotlights @UofTNews More News Announcements Campus Status Statement from the Provost on Prevention and Response to Sexual Violence Academic Life & Research Programs and Areas Research Graduate & Postdoctoral Programs Continuing Studies International Activities Course Calendars & Listings Student & Campus Life Discover U of T Athletics & Recreation Clubs & Extra-curricular Activities Health & Wellness Housing & Residence Arts & Culture Campus Safety Spotlight On Building Successful Cities Transformative Education Healthy Minds & Bodies Fostering Tomorrow\'s Entrepreneurs Resources Important Dates Social Media Directory Portal ROSI Webmail & Scheduling Quick Facts About U of T Administration Tuition & Student Finance Loans, Grants & Scholarships Financial Planning Student Jobs & Career Planning Human Resources & Equity Information For Media Faculty Researchers Staff & Faculty Parents and Families Events More Events U of T Global Read More Discover our gateway to international initiatives and opportunities across all three campuses.

With Data and Resolve, Tacoma Fights Pollution Last year, environmental engineers working for this city had an unnerving worry. After a decade and tens of millions of dollars devoted to a fastidious cleanup of its corner of Puget Sound, Tacoma’s shore front was in danger of being contaminated with a highly toxic chemical. Working their way upstream, the engineers discovered the source of the problem: a storm drain in a residential neighborhood. Black goo stuck to its sides was old grout that contained large concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Used in local road building in 1975, PCBs, odorless and carcinogenic, were outlawed soon thereafter. Yet they were swept up and sent mostly through drain pipes on their way to Puget Sound. Tacoma Rain Gardens Cleaning Contaminants in Thea Foss Waterway Deemed a Superfund site in 1983, the City of Tacoma is now making headway to clean up the contaminated Thea Foss Waterway. The city has been monitoring high levels of chemicals like arsenic and pesticides for 12 years, and recent tests show a decrease in 90 percent of contaminants. Better known for its lights and sounds inside, Dorky\'s Arcade in Tacoma is now getting attention for its efforts outside. Owner Les Vorosbond sponsors one of the city\'s rain gardens. The City of Tacoma has 14 rain gardens, but sponsors only four. Coordinators hope businesses and organizations will chip in and help. Cleaning Urban Waters Using Collaboration and Science Coordinating government agencies, universities, community leaders, and local businesses has led to successful and real-world clean water methods for Tacoma, Washington. 2014 PNW-SETAC 23rd Annual Conference The Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry:Promoting toxicology and chemistry research in the Pacific Northwest - will hold their annual 3-day conference on April 24-26, 2014 in Tacoma, Washington. Staff representing the Center for Urban Waters, City of Tacoma, and University of Washington-Tacoma will be among the many experts presenting at this year\'s conference. Source Control Investigation Leads to Identification of a PCB Source Sediment trap monitoring in the OF237B drainage basin showed intermittent relatively elevated levels of PCBs in two upstream sediment traps. These sediment traps are located in a primarily residential area of East Tacoma. Additional Improvement Found in Stormwater Quality in the Thea Foss Drainage Basin Annual comprehensive stormwater monitoring by the City of Tacoma shows additional improvement in stormwater quality in the Thea Foss drainage basin. Results from Year 7 Thea Foss Waterway Monitoring Appear Promising The City completed Year 7 post-remediation monitoring of the sediments in the Thea Foss and Wheeler-Osgood Waterways, and submitted an annual report summarizing the results to EPA for review in November. Monitoring included sediment chemistry, hydrographic survey, low tide visual monitoring, sediment profile imaging, groundwater monitoring and habitat evaluation.

Numerous synthetic chemicals are released into the environment as a result of use, disposal or accidental discharge. I investigate where these chemicals are likely to end up and whether they breakdown or remain persistent in the environment. Microbial degradation of halogenated chemicals such as perfluorinated chemicals has been a primary focus of my research. Analytical instrumentation is integral in my investigations including techniques such as Gas Chromatography and Liquid Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry.

Prakash B.S., Environmental Science, 2009 Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids in the Puget Sound   Shristi is currently investigating Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids (PFCAs) which are synthetic chemicals applied in carpet, paper and textile industries to render products water and oil repellant. She will be collecting and testing water samples from various locations around the Puget Sound for various chain lengths of PFCAs. These compounds are also used as processing aids in the production of fluoropolymers typically used as non-stick coatings in items such as pots and pans.  PFCAs are characterized by a carboxylic end-group and hydrophobic perfluorinated chain of various lengths. The widespread detection and bioaccumulation of PFCAs in the environment is of increasing concern. Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) the 8 carbon version of PFCAs has been detected in various environmental samples including sediment, biota, ground and surface waters as well as human serum. The potential toxicity of these compounds is also of concern.  This study is important in evaluating all chain lengths of PFCAs since there have been no previous studies examining the presence and concentrations of these emerging class of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Puget Sound.     Student: Portia Leigh BS., Environmental Science, 2009 Fate of Telomer Alcohols in Terrestrial Environments Portia is studying the fate of fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) in terrestrial and plant systems.  FTOHs like many organic chemicals are likely to be found in biosolids resulting from their applications. Soil is a complicated matrix, where organic compounds such as FTOHs typically remain bound.  Extent of binding to soils is a function of the partitioning of these chemicals to organic matter (KOC).  She will be performing experiments using plants native to the Pacific Northweste grown in FTOH spiked soils.  The soil composition that she is using is similar to composition used in rain gardens.  Currently she is developing a method to extract FTOHs from this particular soil type.  Future studies will try to determine plant uptake, loss or biotransformation. Student: Ji Yeam Hydrolysis of Fluorotelomer Monomers Ji is currently investigating the hydrolytic stability of telomer-based monomers as a function of pH and temperature.  He will be testing various chemical linkages tested including ester, ether and urethane linkages. The kinetics and mechanism of hydrolysis as well as identification of products will also be examined.  The hydrolytic stability of these compounds is of importance as they may enter aquatic systems through various routes including urban run off, drainage, waste disposal and industrial effluent. Thus, these compounds may be subjected to hydrolytic reactions that may release fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), compounds found to be precursors to perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCA) such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).  This study is critical in evaluating all potential sources of this emerging class of persistent organic pollutant (POP) in the environment.   Student:  Chris Pyke Water and Sediment Quality Monitoring of First Creek in Tacoma WA: A service learning project in collaboration with City of Tacoma and First Creek Neighbors.

My research interests as an environmental chemist is in investigating what happens to these chemicals as it gets released into the environment. I focus primarily in studying emerging organic pollutants such as Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids (PFCAs), which are chemicals used widely in textile and carpet industries to render products water and dirt repellent. These chemicals have recently been identified as ubiquitous contaminants, found in every environmental matrix studied including various species of wildlife and human blood.

Courses Taught: TNURS 403: Introduction to Nursing Research TNURS 403: Critical Inquiry Exercises TNURS 522: Theory Development for a Practice Discipline      TNURS 403: Introduction to Nursing Research Exercise for Development of Critical Inquiry in Nursing Research Dr. Marjorie Dobratz, Professor mdobratz@u.washington.edu Office:WCG 223 Office Hours: TBA Definition of Critical Thinking Critical thinking is the rational examination of ideas, assumptions, principles, arguments, conclusions, inferences, issues, statements, beliefs and actions (Bandman & Bandman, 1988). The components of critical thinking then are as follows: Assumptions: Something to be taken as true without proof or demonstration. Inferences: The act or process of inferring or deriving a conclusion from facts or premises. Principle: A basic truth, law, or assumption. In more simplistic terms, critical thinking is: Thinking about your thinking--to make your thinking clearer, more accurate (Paul, 1995). Clarifying what is not understood and what is unknown Beginning with what is known Proceeding to understand the unknown Beginning with the Known: Compare the steps of the nursing process (known) with the steps of the research process (unknown) Nursing Process Research Process Phase I: Assessing and setting goals Identifying problem, reviewing literature, defining concepts, developing theoretical framework, identifying purpose Phase II: Formulating nursing diagnoses Formulating hypotheses/research questions Phase III: Planning/Intervening Planning methodology, choosing sample, selecting tools, protecting human subjects, collecting data Phase IV: Evaluating Analyzing data, interpreting results, discussing implications PhaseV: Modifying Sharing Findings, Planning next phase Research then is similar to the steps of the nursing process. Research is a systematic, planned process of inquiry (critical thinking or appraisal) that follows defined steps for the purpose of developing knowledge (answering the research question).. The baccalaureate nursing graduate is expected to critically appraise research, draw conclusions from research findings by understanding the laws that govern the scientific process and then apply research findings in a practice context to improve patient outcomes. The defined systematic, planned steps of the research process are the following: 1. Identifying the research problem 2. Reviewing the selected literature 3. Developing the theoretical framework 4. Defining the purpose 5. Formulating the hypotheses/questions 6. Planning the methodology (design, sample, tools/instuments) 7. Assuring protection of human subjects 8. Collecting the data 9. Analyzing the data 10. Interpreting the results 11. Discussing nursing implications 12. Sharing findings with colleagues Proceeding to the Unknown Phase I. Start with Phase I: Assessing or the process of critical appraisal involves identifying the research problem, rev iewing the supporting literature, developing the underlying theoretical framework, and identifying the purpose of the research project. This first phase of the research project can be thought of as the assessment stage of the investigation. In order to complete Phase I, the researcher must determine the concepts or variables that he/she is interested in studying, how these variables relate to each other, find the evidence in the empirical literature that supports his/her conclusions, determine the theory that logically supports the evidence, and build a clear concise purpose statement of what he/she expects to accomplish. Similarly, as with the nursing process, in the assessment stage, the researcher defines the problem, collects the scientific empirical data and sets the goals (purpose) of the study. identifying concepts clarifying unfamiliar concepts or terms questioning assumptions (something to be taken as true without proof or demonstration) and rationale determing supporting evidence The researcher starts with the basic building blocks which are the concepts. The researcher then puts these basic building blocks together in different ways to form relationships which are termed propositions. These concepts, their definitions, and their relationships (propositions) are called a theory. A concept is a general idea or the meaning of a phenomenon. A concept is termed a variable when it is given a means or way of measurement, that is, it takes on an assigned value. An independent variable (symbolized by x) is the cause of the presumed effect on the outcome (dependent variable) and is the variable that is manipulated in an experimental study. The dependent variable(symbolized by y) is referred to as the outcome or consequence and, thus, is the change or effect that is observed from the variation of the independent variables. Remember that the independent variable is the cause and the dependent variable is the effect. A proposition is a description of the relationship between two or more concepts A theory is a conceptual system or framework invented to some purpose (Dickoff & James, 1968) A theory is a set of defined concepts, definitions, and propositions that present a systemmateic view of a phenomenon for the purpose of explaining and predicting phenomenon (Kerlinger, 1968). A theoretical framework is \"a guide or map to systematically identify logical, precisely defined relationships between variables\" (Lo-Biondo-Woods & Haber, 1999, p.41). Applying the Unknown Using the above definitions, now applying them to aq completed research project. Select the article by: Dobratz, M. C. (1993). Causal influences of psychological adaptation in death and dying. Western Journal of Nursing Research, 15 (6), 708-729, which is on electronic reserve, and answer the following questions: Problem: Locate the problem statement. In what section of a research report would you usually look for the problem statement? How did this investigator determine that a problem existed? Would you agree with the researcher\'s conclusion that new knowledge needed to be developed before she could answer the stated problem? State the facts by which the investigator drew her conclusion or made this inference. According to Lo-Biondo-Woods and Haber (1999), a good problem statement has three components: \"it clearly identifies the variables under consideration, it specifies the population being studied, and it implies the possibility of empirical testing\" (p.67). Does the problem statement in this study adhere to these three defined characterisitics of a good problem statament? Concepts/Variables and Propositions: Identify the concepts/variables that the researcher chose to study in this research project. What are the the independent and dependent variable? Find three propositional statement in the section titled: Theoretical Framework. Find one propositional statement that shows a relationship between two or more variables. How will the researcher measure the variables? What is the difference between conceptual definitions and operational definitions? Theoretical Framework: What were the disciples from which the researcher drew upon to develop the theoretical framework for this study? Following the definition given by Lo-Biondo-Woods and Haber (1999), is the theoretical framework systematically and logically developed? Does it precisely define the relationships between the variables? If so, desribe how the theoretical framework in this study was systematically and logically constructed. If not, describe flaws that occurred in the process of the researcher inferring facts. Think on the assumptions that could be taken as truths in this phase of building the research study. For example, is psychological adaptation an inherent part of the dying process? Do dying individuals occur pain? Is the Roy Adaptation Model of nursing a valid framework to use in constructing the model on page 709? Purpose: What is the purpose of this study? Is it clear to you what the investigator hopes to accomplish in this study? Why is a purpose statement important? Your textbook notes that the purpose statement could indicate the manner in which the researcher will study the problem. That is, one purpose may be to explore relationship. Another may be to predict the effectiveness of certain interventions. Does this purpose statement indicate how the investigator will find the answer to the problem? Phase II. Formulating Hypotheses or Research Questions Go back and review Kerlinger\'s (1968) definition of theory. In this definition, he statest that the purpose of theory is to explain and predict phenomenon. When a reserarcher intends to predict theory, he/she most likely will develop hypotheses for the study. According to Lo-Biondo-Woods and Haber (1999), \"a hypothesis is an assumptive statement about the relationship between two or more variables that suggest an answer to the research question, and then converts the question into a statement that predicts an expected outcome\" (p.73). On the other hand, when an investigator is unable to predict a cause-effect relationship or lacks developed theory to support their predictions, the researcher will formulate research questions. Research questions are posited when the primary purpose of the investigation is to explore or explain relationships among variables. Research questions are also formulated for qualitiative studies whose purpose is to describe a particular phenomenon. As noted in Lo-Biondo-Woods and Haber (1999), \"verbs like discover, explore, or describe suggest an investigation of a little researched topic that might appropriately be guided by research questions rather than hypotheses\" (p.72). Hence, perhaps, you can now see that theory has different levels of complexity and refinement. Starting with the less complex level and moving to the most refined, these were defined by Dickoff, James and Weidenback (1968) as follows: Level I--Description Level II--Exploratory Level III--Prediction Level IV--Situation Producing There are other characteristics that are inherent in research hypotheses and points that the researcher would consider before formulating reserach questions or writing formal hypotheses. They are as follows: 1. Complex research hypotheses contain more than one independent or dependent variable. 2. Directional hypotheses will predict the expected direction of the outcome. Statements such as greater than, lesss than, positively, and negatively identify the predicted relationship between two or more variables. 3. Hypotheses are testable. Consequently, all the variables in the study must have a form of measurement, observation, and analysis. The hypotheses must be tested to accept or refute the predicted outcome. 4. Complete hypotheses statements include: the variables being tested, the population being studied, and the predicted outcome from the testing. 5. A hyptheses is based on existing theory and valid research findings. In summary, before a reseracher writes a formal hypothesis or a less formal research question, they will make inference from existing sources of information. This phase of the research process is similar to that of the nursing process, in that, the nurse examines all soucres of objective and subjective data, makes inference, and then formulates a nursing diagonosis. Now examine the hypotheses in the article by Dobratz (1999) and answer these questions: Hypotheses: Is the first hypotheses complex in nature? List the fact from which you infer your conclusion? Is the thrid hypotheses directional? How do you derive this conclusion? Are the hypotheses based on existing critieria and other valid research findings? Examine the characteristics of complete hypotheses. Do the four hypotheses meet these criteria? Are the hypotheses as written testable? Will be researcher be able to accept or refute the results of the analysis? References Bandman, E.L., & Bandman, B. (1988). Critical thinking in nursing. Norwalk, CT: Appleton & Lange.

ETAPS 2009 is the twelfth joint conference in this series. The conference is organized by the University of York.   Call for Papers The information society is increasingly reliant on software at all levels. Hence, the ability to produce software of high quality at low cost is crucial to technological and social progress. An intrinsic characteristic of software that integrates with real-world processes is the need to evolve in order to adjust to new or changing requirements. Maintaining quality while embracing change is one of the main challenges of software engineering. Software engineers have at their disposal theories, languages, methods, and tools that derive from both the systematic research of the academic community and the experience of practitioners. It is one of the roles of software engineering as a scientific discipline to foster feedback between academia and industry by proposing new solutions and evaluating the effectiveness of those solutions in practical contexts. FASE is concerned with the foundations on which Software Engineering is built. Submissions should focus on novel techniques and the way in which they contribute to making Software Engineering a more mature and sound discipline. Contributions that combine the development of conceptual and methodological advances with their formal foundations and tool support are particularly encouraged. We welcome contributions on all such fundamental approaches, including: Software Engineering as an engineering discipline, including its interaction with and impact on society; Requirements engineering: capture, consistency, and change management of software requirements; Software architectures: description and analysis of the architecture of individual systems or classes of applications; Specification, design, and implementation of particular classes of systems: adaptive, collaborative, embedded, distributed, mobile, pervasive, or service-oriented applications; Software quality: validation and verification of software using theorem proving, model-checking, testing, analysis, metrics or visualisation techniques; Model-driven development and model-transformation: design and semantics of semi-formal visual languages, consistency and transformation of models; Software processes: support for iterative, agile, and open source development; Software evolution: refactoring, reverse and re-engineering, configuration management and architectural change, or aspect-orientation.   Submission ETAPS conferences accept two types of contributions: research papers and tool demonstration papers. Both types of contributions will appear in the proceedings and have presentations during the conference. Submitted papers must be in English presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere (neither conference nor journal). In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden. All papers, especially research papers, should clearly identify their novel contributions to the domain of fundamental approaches to software engineering. One author of each accepted paper must attend the conference to present the paper. Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF (preferably) or PS (using Type 1 fonts). The proceedings will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Final papers will be in the format specified by Springer-Verlag at the URL: http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html Papers should be submitted via the web site of the FASE Conference Service, http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fase09. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately, without review. Research papers Research papers will be not more than 15 pages long (including figures and references). Additional material intended for the referee but not for publication in the final version - for example details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. ETAPS referees are at liberty to ignore appendices, and papers must be understandable without them. Tool demonstration papers Tool demonstration papers should describe novel and state-of-the-art tools. Submissions should consist of two parts. The first part, no more than 4 pages, should describe the tool presented. Please include the URL of the tool (if available) and provide information that illustrates the maturity and robustness of the tool. This part will be included in the proceedings. The second part, no more than 6 pages, should explain how the demonstration will be carried out and what it will show, including screen dumps and examples. This part will not be included in the proceedings, but will be evaluated. Important Dates 2 October 2008 (23:59 Samoa time GMT-11) Submission deadline for abstracts (strict) 9 October 2008 (23:59 Samoa time GMT-11) Submission deadline for full papers (strict) 12 December 2008 Notification of acceptance/rejection 5 January 2008 (23:59 Samoa time GMT-11) Camera-ready version due (strict) 22 March - 29 March 2009 ETAPS 2009 ETAPS deadlines are strict.

It ranks second to the obscenely popular automatic drip but it is a delight to use. The coffee is usually brewed using a mesh filter which is where it differs from the methods of today in which a paper filter is commonly used. The taste and flavor which is produced is very bold and strong and it is up to the drinker to be able to appreciate this. The resulting drink is not as finely blended as would be the result of other methods but the French Press creates a taste of its own which cannot be compared to. The oils which would otherwise be filtered out of the liquid are allowed to accumulate and be evenly distributed in the end product. Some sediment from this brewing do find themselves in the mouth of the drinker but some people prefer that muddy, thick texture while others can’t stand it. Some cons which come commonly associated with the use of the French Press are that the plunger might get stuck or trapped when it is being pulled downwards. This could allow the coffee to be blended more finely which is not desirable. Furthermore, the filter gets dirty very quickly and it needs to be cleaned carefully to preserve the quality of the finished product. The coffee must also be immediately removed from the press or else it continues to stew and might end up becoming quite unpleasant to taste. It is important to find another container into which the liquid should be transferred quickly. There are a few right ways to brew coffee in a French Press and they must be followed closely. So what are the keys to a rich and tasty, perfectly brewed drink? According to Enjoying French Press Coffee – HiLine Coffee Company one must use water which is not entirely boiling. If the water you have is fully boiled, you can mix some cold water in or wait a bit. Pour some boiled water at the bottom of the press to heat it up for starter. After that, you can start work on grinding your coffee beans (this step must be done manually). Freshly ground drinks are better than pre-ground so make sure to put in the extra effort. You may need a burr grinder and it will take some effort since you have to choose slightly larger beans which require more effort. You want to end up with chunks rather than a blended powder. Use a coarse grinder so that this roughness can be left behind after the beans have been ground. Two tablespoon of the mixture is adequate for every cup of water you put into the press. Pour this ratio in and then begin stirring. After that you can cover the press with the lid and leave to brew. Roughly 4 to 5 minutes are allowed for the liquid to reach full maturity in terms of aroma and flavor. For an extra dark color you may leave up to 10 minutes. After the time has passed you can pull down the plunger taking care to not let it get stuck. In this process the mixture will be getting filtered through the mesh filter. You can now pour yourself a cup and enjoy the different feel that comes with using the French Press. Most of the French Presses in the world by manufactured by Bodum who has for decades made them using a variety of materials such as glass, metal and plastic. The size of the French Press can even be big enough to accommodate 12 cups of coffee in it. How To Replace An Asphalt Roof Posted by ecm42 in Home | Comments Off Asphalt roofs are amongst the most common types of roofs you will find. If this is the type of material used on your home and you’ve been facing issues like leaks etc then you will be happy to know it doesn’t need to be overly difficult when you adequately prepare. When you take on a home improvement project of this nature, it’s important to decide whether you want to take this on yourself, or hire a roofing contractor that has received many good reviews from friends and other online sources. There are times when it is not necessary to replace the entire roof and performing a spot replacement of deteriorated shingles in place of old, weathered ones can sometimes be perfectly acceptable if the sheathing below is in acceptable condition. There are a few easy ways to detect that a shingle has outlived its natural life and that is when the grit on the top starts peeling off or there is none left at all. Tabs could also be absent as they can come off with wind and the like. You may also need to replace a shingle when leaves and debris have been able to get under it because that means the top layer is weak and will eventually erode away completely. There are roughly six steps to replacing shingles and the first step involves carefully removing the old ones. You don’t want to damage the base, so do this carefully using a special hammer or tool. Cleaning at this point is also wise as you won’t get a chance to do this later on. Next, you need to deal with any nails that are still installed and a nail puller or screw driver must be used and again you need to be gentle enough to not damage the lining. Start from the absolute bottom of the roof and work your way up installing one shingle and then another about a quarter over it. The pattern must be consistent in order to look neat from the ground. The shingles must obviously be fastened securely and it is wise to use galvanized nails for this. The holes left behind by the previous nails need to be filled up with cement. The wood can be damaged if the holes are left open. Another option is to put new nails into the same holes to secure the material in place. Put the cement under the shingle and place it on the roof and then press the second shingle on top of it firmly for a professional look to your home. One well-known contractor who is an Ellicott City roofer advises not replace your roof if winter temperatures are too low as the cement might dry too quickly or be ineffective. springtime is best. Other residents have confirmed that not only is installation more difficult in poor weather, but there is greater chance for a rushed job. This is why many homeowners in Maryland have opted to hire a well-reviewed Bethesda roofing contractors that are recommended by previous customers. When it comes to protecting your home, it is often wise to leave it up to the pros. Asphalt is by definition not very sturdy compared to slate or metal, which is why it is important to really perfect this skill of proper installation because chances are you might have to perform a repair if not properly executed. The main reason why these types of materials are chosen is because they are really cheap and easy to apply. They do however weather very easily and get exposed to the elements. Asphalt roofs have amongst the highest average of leaky roofs. However they work well for drier areas and warmer weather. The Best Places To Live Near San Diego Posted by ecm42 in Real Estate | Comments Off San Diego is the dreamland of suburban living and few areas can compare to the plush living that can be found in its neighborhoods. There are a number of areas that are absolutely breathtaking and worth investing in, in terms of a home. San Diego has long been designated as the area where clean living is truly possible since environmental pollution has been greatly controlled there and there is more greenery and wide spaces. If nothing else, the entire metro area is a brilliant place on the whole for children to grow up in because of the fine schools and recreational facilities that are found there. Poway is one city that comes to mind when one talks about the San Diego metro area. There is plenty of opportunity for outdoor recreation there and it is a very scenic location to live in. Poway is great for families and children and there is proximity to school districts making it ideal. Chula Vista is a close second in terms of ease of living and population. It has upwards of 165,00 residents and although it is too cramped now to be of use regarding real estate deals, valuable properties are still sold regularly and there is always the odd pre-foreclosure to look forward to. Commuting to the South Bay is still difficult but the distances really add to the small town feel that Chula Vista is still very much about. The EastLake area is where you want to be, if you have young kids who need to go to school. La Mesa is a city in this county and it reeks of beauty and the same small town appeal and fine houses that you will find in the Chula Vista real estate market. There is a downtown village as well as wonderful suburban neighborhoods. There is no shortage of parks and facilities for outdoor fun which is why it boasts of such brilliant family life. La Jolla however takes the cake as one of the richest communities in San Diego with the most aesthetic appeal. The area is predominately sea-oriented and hilly. Buying a home in La Jolla can be quite expensive, even for California. The views are to die for. Not to mention that it has top-notch school districts and outdoor facilities in the county. Its name is derived from a native Indian term to describe this sort of topographical location. If you can afford to make the move and live in one of these dream locations, then right now is the ideal time as the real estate market has been facing fluctuations this year. If you could get a good price at any time of the year then this would be it.   Stock Trading Software Posted by ecm42 in Uncategorized | Comments Off Stock Trading is at an all-time high nowadays because of increased volatility in stock which has not been seen at this level for many years. Most people find the services of any software application package very useful but in any case there are a few prerequisites to bear in mind when you are registering with one. These programs help their clients in engaging in stock trading and also provide all kinds of relevant data without which accurate risk taking would be impossible. When you are buying stock trading software, try to look beyond the cost in terms of money and how popular it may or may not be and focus more on how user-friendly it is and whether or not it can be navigated without difficulty. There are several types of trading software out there that carry out a number of functions and you can buy according to your needs and preferences. Day traders for example are more concerned with news in real- time as they have to make major decisions rather quickly. Fundamental investors are going to want to carry out economic scanning and scanning of companies. Some stock traders are simply more interested in keeping tabs on certain trades and then jumping in when they see an opportunity present itself. Always choose your respective stock trading software after carefully examining what your trading style is and what your goals are, whether they be short-term or long-term. Now bear in mind that each vendor is going to offer a variety of features and there will be something new each time. The two major types of stock trading software that you need to concern yourself with are firstly the trading funds software and secondly the software that normal individuals use. The applications that are used mostly by funds are very particular about such things as execution speed and the concept of detecting advantages as soon as possible. Stock trading software from providers like Lightspeed offer an excellent way to obtain stock quotes as soon as possible in real-time and providing really fast execution speed. The apps that are intended for use by individuals tend to be (as the name would suggest) more concerned about their interface and accessibility. Keep in mind that stock traders need to be able to process large amounts of information very quickly and then also sort it out in the relevant categories for a good overall user experience. The software will be hardwired to track the trades you want tracked and also to evaluate for you if a certain trade is worth the risk or not. The timing and price ranges of stocks are essential and the software will evaluate your best bet based on your current financial position. Social Media In SEO Posted by ecm42 in Uncategorized | Comments Off One way of improving your online business is looking for novel ways to reach out for customers.  When some of the available networking sites are used, business owners are not only able to look for new clients but also they are capable of connecting with more people. According to Maryland Search, a leading Maryland SEO agency, social media is among the most excellent techniques of reaching out to new groups of people online. A lot of people are using social media to improve their online business nowadays. Social media enhances the search for online clients for business owners. The new face of SEO is very different from what it used to be. It no longer involves manipulation of search engine spiders or stuffing web content with numerous keywords. Rather, the optimization environment has gone through a lot of changes. As a result, it is has become more human focused than ever. Within this modern landscape of SEO, there is need for SEO service providers or website owners to focus on optimizing their client’s efforts in order to create a strong presence of genuine humans. They should then use this to generate traffic to their sites. Whether you’re a Baltimore SEO company or a plumber in Seattle, the principles are the same. The best way to achieve this is to take full advantage of social media. Social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn as well as other social networking platforms have become the top digital means of promoting and advertising products as well as spreading news. With the numerous uncontrollable trends, there is need for you to adapt to the new online search rank modifications if at all you would like your domain to remain on top. This means doing away with a few old practices that involved manipulation of codes. Therefore, you need to learn how to involve authentic human readers on a level that is practical and continuous.  One way to achieve this is to focus on value rather than concentrating on search engine algorithms.  Your focus should be creating content that is long-lasting. Good content that people will not only pay attention to but also share.  Instead of designing websites and link profiles whose quality is for appeal purposes only, create a site that is well-organized and capable of identifying real human interest niches. After developing a site with great content, joining the social network landscape should be your next move. This involves creating accounts in various major networks where majority of your niche target candidates are likely to be found. Your accounts ought to bear the name of your online domain brand. Once you have done this, start integrating your actual site pages with social media. Do not put yourself in a situation whereby people find your content interesting but they are unable share it with other people. Lastly, keep creating and promoting your site pages. Social media and search engines depend highly on freshness. One can constantly develop a large social fan base by regularly posting new fascinating links and apps. In this digital landscape of SEO, self-promotion is very crucial when it comes to human audience. Hence if you want to elevate your general SEO rank, integrating your site pages with social media is a skill that you need to master.

Insanity Workout Review Posted by ecm42 in Uncategorized | Comments Off Fitness is a trend that never goes out of style. If you are looking to lose some weight and bring your body back in shape you are going to love the Insanity Workout from Beachbody. One could argue that there might be a more effective home physical fitness program out there and you may be able to find an occasional Insanity Workout review that cites the need for better innovation in exercise routines, but this workout does have a lot of positive points. Adequate research on whether these exercises will even suit you or not is essential because it is a lot of money or it may seem so at first. Beachbody offers you 10 action packed DVDs and it recommends you attempt this workout for roughly 60 days to see positive results. Many users have confessed to losing as many as 2 inches off their waist and hips. The Workout itself begins with a somewhat long speech by Shawn.T and he explains why you have just spent a $100 on this workout and what it can do for you in the short and long term. The most attractive part is naturally the fact that you only have to do this for a few minutes a day and you never have to leave your home and your responsibilities to go to a gym. The first shortfall is that the workout is only as effective as it claims if you have been following the strict diet outlined by the creator. At the very least you should be following something similar. Also regularity is a must without which you cannot hope to get the results that are so widely advertised in relation to the Insanity Workout. Shawn.T lays down three prerequisites which the more chubby ones of us will have trouble following. These include staying motivated and trying your level best and also getting the notion out of your mind that any of this is going to be hassle free. With most customers the results have been widely positive and this makes the workout a success to say the least. At the end you can safely expect that your body fat will be greatly reduced. Since the workout makes you sweat like never before, you will be burning fat pretty fast. Moreover the Insanity workout gives you muscle definition. Now, most bodybuilders are more interested in muscle mass and this workout does provide that to some extent but it mainly focuses on enhancing the best parts of your body. The Insanity workout is perfect for getting a sculpted body in a very short period of time but it does come at a heavy price. Not only is the price a matter of contention, it is going to hurt a lot as well when you really get into it for the first time.

Recent Events Please join us in congratulating Yiru Li, Sarah George, Craig Apfelbeck, Abdeltawab Hendawi, David Hazel, Ankur Teredesai and Mohamed Ali on winning the \"Best Demo\" award at the ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS Conference 2014  on the iTornado system. The paper is titled: “Routing Service With Real World Severe Weather” and presents a framework for routing services to evacuate vehicles under real world severe weather threats. The system is able to: (1) Identify the users inside the dangerous region of a severe weather event, (2) Recommend an evacuation route to guide the users out to a safe destination or shelter, (3) Assure the recommended route to be one of the shortest paths after excluding the risky area, and  (4) Maintain the flow of traffic by normalizing the evacuation on the possible safe routes. For additional information, please visit the Geospatial Data Management page of the Center for Data Science: http://cwds.uw.edu/geospatial-data-management” Dr. George Mobus, Associate Professor in Computer Science & Systems and Computer Engineering & Systems, has just had his textbook (along with co-author Professor Emeritus Michael Kalton of IAS) entitled Principles of Systems Science published by Springer, New York. This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. The book contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. Please join us in congratulating Dr. Mobus on this major accomplishment.

ETAPS 2010 is the thirteenth joint conference in this series.    Call for Papers FASE is concerned with the foundations on which Software Engineering is built. Submissions should not focus on the application or evaluation of given methods, tools or techniques for their own sake but, rather, the principles on which they are based and the way in which they contribute to making Software Engineering a more mature and soundly-based discipline. Contributions that combine the development of conceptual and methodological advances with their formal foundations and tool support are particularly encouraged. We welcome contributions on all such fundamental approaches, including: Software engineering as a classical engineering discipline, including interaction of software engineering with and impact on society; Requirements engineering: elicitation, specification, consistency, and change management of software requirements; Software architectures: description and analysis of the architecture of individual systems or classes of applications, including product-line architectures and aspect orientation; Specification, design, and implementation of particular classes of systems: adaptive, collaborative, embedded, distributed, mobile, pervasive, ultra large-scale or service-oriented applications; Model-driven development: model transformation, design and semantics of semi-formal visual languages, and consistency of models; Software quality: validation and verification of software using theorem proving, model-checking, testing, analysis, metrics or visualisation techniques; Software processes, including support for iterative, agile, and open source development; Software evolution: refactoring, reverse and re-engineering, configuration management and architectural change. Submission ETAPS conferences accept two types of contributions: research papers and tool demonstration papers. Both types of contributions will appear in the proceedings and have presentations during the conference. Submitted papers must be in English presenting original research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere (neither conference nor journal). In particular, simultaneous submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden. All papers, especially research papers, should clearly identify their novel contributions to the domain of fundamental approaches to software engineering. One author of each accepted paper must attend the conference to present the paper. Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF (preferably) or PS (using Type 1 fonts). The proceedings will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Final papers will be in the format specified by Springer-Verlag at the URL: http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately, without review. As electronical submission system we use EasyChair. Please use http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fase10  to submit your paper. Research papers Research papers will be not more than 15 pages long (including figures and references). Additional material intended for the referee but not for publication in the final version - for example details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. ETAPS referees are at liberty to ignore appendices, and papers must be understandable without them. Tool demonstration papers Tool demonstration papers should describe novel and state-of-the-art tools. Submissions should consist of two parts. The first part, no more than 4 pages, should describe the tool presented. Please include the URL of the tool (if available) and provide information that illustrates the maturity and robustness of the tool. This part will be included in the proceedings. The second part, no more than 6 pages, should explain how the demonstration will be carried out and what it will show, including screen dumps and examples. This part will not be included in the proceedings, but will be evaluated. Important Dates 1 October 2009: Submission deadline for abstracts (strict)    8 October 2009: Submission deadline for full papers (strict) 11 December 2009: Notification of acceptance/rejection 4 January 2010: Camera-ready versions due (strict) 20-28 March 2009: ETAPS 2010 ETAPS deadlines are strict. Making the deadline for submission of abstracts a week early allows the programme committee to start work before full versions are available. Submission of an abstract implies no obligation to submit a full version; abstracts with no corresponding full versions by the final deadline will be treated as withdrawn.

Get Access Introduction In contrast to computer systems, human behaviour is only predictable to a certain degree of probability. In semi-automated business processes human actors are guided by predetermined policies and regulations but retain the freedom to react to unforeseen events. For example, if an urgent prescription has to be dispensed by a pharmacist and the current pharmacist on duty is busy, it is likely that they would interrupt their current activity. The assignment policies in a model of this process should accurately define exception handling procedures in order to realistically simulate business processes. Other policies may require task assignment to the least-qualified person available to do the job if the people involved have different levels of access rights and qualifications.

Public / Patient: 4.3  3 ratings Health Professionals: 4.5  2 ratings A computer system which enables medical students to practise diagnosing and managing patients in simulations using real patient data is being developed in an interdepartmental collaborative project between Leicester Medical School and the Computer Science Department at the University of Leicester. The software development, led by Professor Reiko Heckel in collaboration with Dr. John Barry Omara, will improve supervision of medical students during their clinical placements and provide feedback on their diagnoses and treatment choices through a web-based medical decision support system. The way it is designed to work is that in simulated context, medical students will talk to patients and put the clinical symptoms signs and laboratory or radiological data into the system, which then makes suggestions as to possible diagnoses. As a Teaching-Learning support tool, the students then have to interpret these suggestions and give reasons for their conclusions. It grew out of an idea from Dr John Omara, part-time lecturer at the School of Medicine, to improve health care in rural areas of Africa, and has evolved through a number of past and on-going projects by Computer Science students. In its present form as a training tool for medical students, it will not be used to treat hospital patients. The \'Virtual Teaching Hospital System\' project, demonstrated to Her Majesty the Queen on her recent visit to the University, is carried out in cooperation with Dr Omara and in consultation with the Department of Medical and Social Care Education. Those who met the Queen included the group of Computer Science students who won the BEA Systems Award for the best second year project, namely Mayur Bapodra, Jung-Ming Chong, John Pickering, and Dumisani Papaya, as well as postgraduate student Adwoa Donyina, who continued this work in her MSc project and is now doing her PhD at the Department. Adwoa Donyina commented: \"The teaching system will assist medical students in rehearsing the problem solving process and help decide what patient information is needed to determine a possible diagnosis and management, while combing the knowledge of the patient\'s history. This expert system will provide guidance and direction with the evolving notion of what might support or refute the diagnosis.\" Professor Heckel added: \"This is an on-going series of group projects for second-year Computer Science students. Five groups of 6-8 students each work on the project for one term. We are about to begin another round of group projects this winter to extend and improve the system and we will carry on offering it as an option to our students as long as there is a significant amount of work to do on it. \"All the groups work on the same project and at the end of the term we choose the best solution. That way, there is a good chance of getting results of a high quality.\" Dr. John Omara said: \"The project, when implemented, will make it easier to explain and teach the complex process involved in making clinical diagnosis (The Clinical Thinking Process).\" Dr Jonathan Hales, Department of Medical and Social Care Education, added: \"The value of the system lies in the way the VTHS can be used by medical students to explore \'what if\' scenarios - i.e. \'what if this same patient presented with the same symptoms and signs but also with a temperature (or, \'but without the abdominal pain)?\' . The value of the system does not therefore lie solely in its ability to come up with useful differential diagnoses, but in its educational capacity, when used by a thoughtful, questioning, exploratory student.\" University of Leicester Adapted by MNT from original media release References Additional information Citations These tabs require JavaScript to be enabled.

Visit the website. Welcome The European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS) is the premier conference for both researchers and practitioners to exchange the latest advances in the state of the art and practices of Web Services. The main objectives of this conference are to facilitate the exchange between researchers and practitioners and to foster future collaborations in Europe and beyond. The success encountered by the Web has shown that tightly coupled software systems are only good for niche markets, whereas loosely coupled software systems can be more flexible, more adaptive and often more appropriate in practice. Loose coupling makes it easier for a given system to interact with other systems, possibly legacy systems that share very little with it. Web services are at the crossing of distributed computing and loosely coupled systems. When applications adopt service-oriented architectures, they can evolve during their lifespan more easily and better adapt to changing or unpredictable environments. When properly implemented, services can be discovered and invoked dynamically using non-proprietary mechanisms, while each service can still be implemented in a black-box manner. This is important from a business perspective since each service can be implemented using any technology, independently of the others. What matters is that everybody agrees on the integration technology, and there is a consensus about this in today’s middleware market: customers want to use Web technologies. Despite these promises, however, service integrators, developers, and providers need to create methods tools and techniques to support cost-effective development and the use of dependable services and service-oriented applications. This year\'s keynote speakers are: Paul W.P.J.Grefen, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands: \"Service-Oriented Business Integration: Will we be Dynamic?\". K. Scott Morrison, Layer 7 Technologies, USA: \"How to Fail with Web Services\". Follow us on Twitter      25th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing Track on Service Oriented Architectures and Programming Sierre, Switzerland 21 - 26 March, 2010 Call For Paper Important Dates Submissions PC Members Track Chairs ACM SAC 2010 Home                                         ACM SAC 2010 For the past twenty-four years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing has been a primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists, computer engineers, software engineers, and application developers from around the world. SAC 2010 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), and is hosted by University of Applied Sciences, Western Switzerland (HES-SO) and Ecole Polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. SOAP Track: call for papers Although when considered from a purely technological point of view Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is not an enormous novelty, , when considered from a programming paradigm perspective it is quickly changing our vision of the Web. Originally, the Web was indeed mainly seen as a mean of presenting the information to a wide spectrum of people, but SOC is triggering a radical shift to a vision of the Web as a computational fabric where loosely coupled services interact publishing their interfaces inside dedicated repositories, where they can be searched by other services, retrieved and invoked, always abstracting from the actual implementation. In the context of this modern paradigm we have to cope with an old challenge, like in the early days of Object-Oriented Programming when, until key features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and proper design methodologies were defined, consistency in the programming model definition was not achieved. The complex scenario of Service Oriented Programming needs to be clarified on many aspects, both from the engineering and from the foundational point of view. From the engineering point of view, there are open issues at many levels. Among others, at the system design level, both traditional approaches based on UML and approaches taking inspiration from business process modelling, e.g. BPMN, are used. At the composition level, although WS-BPEL is a de-facto industrial standard, other approaches are appearing, and both the orchestration and choreography views have their supporters. At the description and discovery level there are two separate communities pushing respectively the semantic approach (ontologies, OWL, ...) and the syntactic one (WSDL, ...). In particular, the role of discovery engines and protocols is not clear. In this respect we still lack adopted standards: UDDI looked to be a good candidate, but it is no longer pushed by the main corporations, and its wide adoption seems difficult. Furthermore, a new different implementation platform, the so-called REST services, is emerging and competing with classic Web Services. Finally, features like Quality of Service, security and dependability need to be taken seriously into account, and this investigation should lead to standard proposals. From the foundational point of view, formalists have discussed widely in the last years, and many attempts to use formal methods for specification and verification in this setting have been made. Session correlation, service types, contract theories and communication patterns are only a few examples of the aspects that have been investigated. Moreover, several formal models based upon automata, Petri nets and algebraic approaches have been developed. However most of these approaches concentrated only on a few features of Service Oriented Systems in isolation, and a comprehensive approach is still far from being achieved. The Service Oriented Architectures and Programming track aims at bringing together, for the second year, researchers and practitioners having the common objective of transforming Service Oriented Programming into a mature discipline with both solid scientific foundations and software engineering development methodologies supported by dedicated tools. In particular, we will encourage works and discussions about what Service Oriented Programming still needs in order to achieve its original goal, along with works proposing comparisons among different models and technological solutions. Major topics of interest will include: Formal Methods for specification of Web Services Notations and models for Service Oriented Computing Methodologies for Service Oriented application design Tools for service oriented application design Service Oriented Middlewares Service Oriented Programming languages Test methodologies for Service Oriented applications Analysis techniques and tools Service systems performance analysis Industrial deployment of tools and methodologies Standards for Service Oriented Programming Service application case studies Dependability and Web Services Quality of Service Security Issues in Service Oriented Computing Comparisons between different approaches to Services Statement papers about future possible directions for research Exception Handling in composition languages Trust and Web Services Important Dates (strict) September 8, 2009: Paper submissions (extended to September 15, 2009) October 19, 2009: Author notification November 2, 2009: Camera-Ready Copy March 22-26, 2010: Conference Submissions Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers using the eCMS site : http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/SAC2010/ Submission of the same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed.

However, humans are only predictable to a degree of certainty because, while guided by policies and regulations, they retain the freedom to ignore established procedures or positively react to unforeseen events. Since we cannot change people, we have to be able to recognize their unpredictable behaviour by organising processes in such a way as to benefit from the flexibility of their actions and deal with the problems that arise from it. Business processes tend to be a structured sequence of events; however the assignment of humans to scheduled cases is unstructured. Hence, it is difficult to accurately model and simulate the flexibility of human resource allocation without considering the impact of unpredictable human behaviour. While business processes often have a rigid structure, determining sequences of actions on each individual case, there is flexibility in the selection of cases to be processed as well as in the assignment of human resources. However, such a flexible use of resources poses its own challenges, making process execution difficult to model and predict. In this thesis I propose a methodology and language to support the modelling and evaluation of business process executions with flexible assignment of human resources. The main idea is to model configurations of a business process as graphs and use graph transformation rules in a UML-like syntax to describe the process execution. This model allows to define conditions to temporarily permit actors to exceed their roles in exceptional (escalated) situations, without causing legal repercussions. The evaluation of process execution models is supported by the use of stochastic graph transformations, which allow the qualitative analysis of different organizational policies through simulation. The methodology is presented in four stages of (1) business modelling, (2) process execution design, (3) process encoding and (4) performance evaluation. A case study of a pharmacy process is used to evaluate the approach. Links:  http://hdl.handle.net/2381/9915 Type:  Thesis Level:  Doctoral Qualification:  PhD Rights:  Copyright © the author, 2011.

Scientists from Leicester and Nottingham have devised a method for identifying levels of exposure to environmental arsenic – by testing toenail clippings. Arsenic occurs naturally in the environment and people can be exposed to it in several ways, for example through contaminated water, food, dust or soil. The risk of exposure is greater in certain areas of the UK where the natural geology and historic mining activities have led to widespread contamination of the environment with arsenic. Long term exposure to arsenic is associated with increases in lung, liver, bladder and kidney cancers and skin growths. Previous studies using hair have suggested high levels of arsenic in the bodies of King George III and Napoleon Bonaparte. Now doctoral research at the British Geological Survey by Mark Button of the University of Leicester has used toenail clippings to find fresh evidence of exposure to environmental arsenic within a UK population living close to a former arsenic mine. The research, published online ahead of print in the Journal of Environmental Monitoring, was carried out with Dr Gawen Jenkin, Department of Geology, University of Leicester; Dr Chris Harrington, School of Science and Technology at Nottingham Trent University and Dr Michael Watts of the British Geological Survey. The research was funded by the British Geological Survey. Mark Button said “We initially identified high levels of arsenic in earthworms living in contaminated soils surrounding the former mine. That got us thinking about potential exposure in people living close to the site.” The researchers collected toenails and washed and acid digested the samples under microwave irradiation. They then analysed the samples using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Mark Button added: “This preliminary research indicates that people living close to a former arsenic mine have elevated levels of arsenic in their toenails. However, the potential health risks in this case, if any, are not yet clear and no arsenic related health issues have been reported. A large-scale and more detailed biomonitoring study is required to confirm these initial results.” Dr Jenkin, lecturer in Applied Geology at the University of Leicester said: “This is the first time that the chemical form of the arsenic in the toenails has been measured – that can tell us something about how it got in there and possible risk factors. Dr Jenkin added: “There is definitely more research needed to look at - amongst other things - a larger sample of volunteers, to see if the values change with time (it is quite possible the high values recorded are a one-off for that person, or due to slow toenail growth concentrating harmless quantities of arsenic), and to look at the possible pathways by which the arsenic is ingested. Coupling our analyses with regular blood measurements would be very revealing.” However the researchers are definitely NOT requiring people to send in their toenail clippings. Neither can you assess arsenic contamination simply by looking at your toenails. Dr Jenkin said: “Even in those people with elevated amounts it is present in tiny quantities – less than 0.003% in the toenail. In people who have not been exposed at all it is less than 0.00003%. If a nail looks different from normal that is usually due to physical damage (you stubbed your toe or dropped something on it) or a minor fungal infection that can be easily cleared up by a visit to the doctor.” NOTE TO NEWSDESK: Please cite University of Leicester; British Geological Survey and Nottingham Trent University in any report More information from: Mark Button or Michael Watts British Geological Survey, Keyworth, Nottingham, NG12 5GG, UK.

Variational analysis and optimization I am interested in the properties of polynomial root functions and spectral functions, which arise in eigenvalue optimization problems. Examples of spectral functions are the spectral abscissa (largest real part of an eigenvalue) and spectral radius (largest eigenvalue in modulus), which are tied to the asymptotic behavior of dynamical systems. This paper (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362546X11000319) concerns the variational analysis of polynomial root functions and am co-authoring a second on spectral max functions. I am also co-authoring a paper on root activity of the polynomial radius & abscissa at local optima, subject to affine constraints. Statistics, data visualization applied to public health surveillance My work in statistics and data visualization revolves around my involvement in a public health project for influenza surveillance. This work consists of three main components: data visualization, identifying patterns of error in data and developing an automated routine for error detection, and generating prediction intervals for the proxy flu rate. I co-wrote a The accrued package in R for visualizing data quality of partially accruing data, which can be found here: http://cran.r-project.org/.Consulting I offer mathematical and statistical consulting to faculty and students at UWT.

Forrest, JD, PhD [an error occurred while processing this directive] What is attachment? In essence, adult attachment is a state of mind about how secure one is in whether others will be available in times of stress and how worthy one is to receive needed support.  Longitudinal research over the last two decades is establishing that adult attachment state of mind reflects early relational experiences with primary caregivers.  Experiences, such as love, rejection, neglect, pressure to achieve, trauma, or loss of a loved one, are important components in assessing attachment state of mind.  Why is attachment relevant to sport? (Insert section information here.) Why is the relationship between attachment and sport important to society? (Insert section information here.)

Beginning with an exploration of our relationship to the stuff we create and exchange (The Plenitude), then moving into questions about technological evolution and innovation (The Nature of Technology), we conclude with examples of how information technologies continue to shape our concepts of what is natural and artificial, and how those perspectives have changed our lives (Hamlet’s Blackberry). Core The Core program consists of a coordinated series of courses that represent the various disciplines in the university. This course, along with the others in your cohort, fulfills one of the university’s general education requirements in each of the areas of knowledge plus composition. The courses are designed to both support and challenge you to develop the critical thinking, writing, research, and analytical skills you’ll need at UWT while introducing you to relevant topics in the social sciences, humanities, and sciences. Learning Objectives ¥ Express ideas clearly in writing and speaking in orders to synthesize and evaluate information before presenting it ¥ Identify, analyze, and summarize/represent the key elements of a text ¥ Think outside of cultural norms and values, including own perspectives to critically engage the larger world ¥ Approach complex issues by taking a large question and breaking it down into manageable pieces ¥ Make meaningful connections among assignments and readings in order to develop a sense of the big picture ¥ Collect, evaluate, and analyze information and resources to solve problems or answer questions Required Texts Arthur, W.

Teaching and Learning Center The TLC provides a wide variety of instructional resources and support for teaching and learning at UW Tacoma. Teaching and learning are ongoing processes that take practice, commitment, and time. We are here to assist you in achieving your goals and provide math/quantitative, writing, science, and other tutoring services. http://www.tacoma.washington.edu/tlc/ Academic Standards/Plagiarism All student work must be free of plagiarism. Plagiarism is defined in the University catalog and in the Student Handbook. Consult your professor if you have any questions. A major part of your experience in the class will be reading, synthesizing, and using the knowledge and ideas of others. It is the responsibility of the faculty to help you in this process and to be certain you learn to credit the work of others upon which you draw. To plagiarize is to appropriate and to pass off, as one\'s own ideas, writing or works of another. Plagiarism is no less of a misconduct violation than vandalism or assault. Ignorance of proper documentation procedures is the usual cause of plagiarism. This ignorance does not excuse the act. Students are responsible for learning how and when to document and attribute resources used in preparing a written or oral presentation. For more information, please refer to the Academic Honesty: Cheating and Plagiarism document prepared by the Committee on Academic Conduct in the College of Arts and Sciences, UW Seattle: http://depts.washington.edu/grading/issue1/honesty.htm Library The UWT Library provides resources and services to support students at all levels of expertise. We guide students through the research process, helping them learn how to develop effective research strategies and find and evaluate appropriate resources. For more information about the Library and its services, see: http://www.tacoma.washington.edu/library/ Electronic Devices Electronic devices (e.g., i-Pads, and laptops) may only be used in the classroom for course-related work. Cell phone use is not permitted. Activities that are non-relevant to the course, such as texting, talking on the phone, checking/sending email, playing games, and surfing the web, are considered disruptive activities when class is in session.

Recent Events Please join us in congratulating Yiru Li, Sarah George, Craig Apfelbeck, Abdeltawab Hendawi, David Hazel, Ankur Teredesai and Mohamed Ali on winning the \"Best Demo\" award at the ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS Conference 2014  on the iTornado system. The paper is titled: “Routing Service With Real World Severe Weather” and presents a framework for routing services to evacuate vehicles under real world severe weather threats. The system is able to: (1) Identify the users inside the dangerous region of a severe weather event, (2) Recommend an evacuation route to guide the users out to a safe destination or shelter, (3) Assure the recommended route to be one of the shortest paths after excluding the risky area, and  (4) Maintain the flow of traffic by normalizing the evacuation on the possible safe routes. For additional information, please visit the Geospatial Data Management page of the Center for Data Science: http://cwds.uw.edu/geospatial-data-management” Dr. George Mobus, Associate Professor in Computer Science & Systems and Computer Engineering & Systems, has just had his textbook (along with co-author Professor Emeritus Michael Kalton of IAS) entitled Principles of Systems Science published by Springer, New York. This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. The book contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. Please join us in congratulating Dr. Mobus on this major accomplishment.

Thanks to Chico, Holly, Lee Rammer and all the brandy snifting locals at the PM Bar, Rob\'s initial foray into the life of the mind was quite short-lived, nudged gently back to the Big Apple by the kindly Dean of Men who understood that some folks are not fodder for the etherial world of belle lettres or the bedlam of Sigma Nu. Six years of peddling herring and getost out of a Tribeca warehouse was enough to shake some sense into him, and off to a business degree at Baruch College, CUNY he went. More thanks to John Todd, Chuck Bazerman and Paula Berggren for ridding that foolish notion from his mind and setting him on a literary path that meandered to financial journalism (hi Roz!), an internship at CNN (hi Mike!), and the briefest of stints at American Banker, breathing the same air as Bill Zimmerman for a couple of months. Jump to Brooklyn\'s MFA program -- ah, memories -- (hi Peter!), the cast and crew of RJ\'s Bar-B-Que (Billy, I swear I never stole from you), and working as a part-time instructor of English and literature at Stern College for Women, Baruch College, Long Island University and the New School for Social Research until the blessed hooding event of 1993, which landed him at NJIT\'s Humanities Department for six years of indentured servitude. A shot at the Big Show across the river at N(ext)Y(ear)IT(ransfer), and back across the river and into the tutelage of Fadi Deek and Jim McHugh -- life-givers and life-changers both. They and Steve Seidman took a shot with Rob as their emissary to Provo one snowy winter after the Y2K scare, where he met the core group of what is now ACM\'s SIG-Information Technology Education. 10 years later, he\'s living in idyllic Gig Harbor, WA with Lorie, Wrigley & Lola, and occasionally Jack, stacking wood, herding cats, and promoting the careers and aspirations of students and faculty of the Institute of Technology. What a long, strange trip it\'s been.                    Rob Friedman, PhD| Director, Institute of Technology UWT     HOME   Papers and Books Journal Articles, Peer-Reviewed 1. R. Collins, A.

My hobbies are raquetball, golf, chess, hold-em, and basketball.  I have a wife of 28 years Gloria, my son George is a Captain in the Army stationed in Germany, and my daughter Sharon graduted from Farleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, majoring as a lab scientist.  She now works as a lab tech in NYC.

Refer to the Curriculum Vitae for full details of his scholarly work. Sharecropper\'s Troubadour Descended from African American slaves, Native Americans, and white slaveowners, John Handcox was born to a family of poor Arkansas sharecroppers at one of the hardest times to be black in America. Over the first few decades of the twentieth century, he survived attempted lynchings, floods, droughts, and the ravages of the Great Depression to organize black and white farmers alike on behalf of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. He also became one of the most beloved folk singers of the prewar labor movement, composing songs such as \"Roll the Union On\" and \"There Is Mean Things Happening in this Land\" that bridged racial divides and kept the spirits of striking workers high. Though he withdrew from the public eye for nearly forty years, missing the \"folk boom\" of the 1960s, he resurfaced decades later - just in time to denounce the policies of the Reagan administration in song - and his work was embraced by new generations of labor activists and folk music devotees. This fascinating and beautifully told oral history gives us John Handcox in his own words, recounting a journey that began in a sharecropper\'s shack in the Deep South and went on to shape the labor music tradition, all amid the tangled and troubled history of the United States in the twentieth century. \"A deeply moving account of the life and struggles of John Handcox who became known as \'the sharecropper\'s troubadour\' for the songs he wrote and sang at union meetings in Arkansas, Mississippi, and throughout the nation. Honey\'s book is essential reading to understand the history of labor and black music in the rural south.\"   --William Ferris, author of The Storied South: Voices of Writers and Artists \"An arresting account of the exemplary life of an American genius.

People forget that Dr. King was every bit as committed to economic justice as he was to ending racial segregation. He fought throughout his life to connect the labor and civil rights movements, envisioning them as twin pillars for social reform. As we struggle with massive unemployment, a staggering racial wealth gap, and the near collapse of a financial system that puts profits before people, King\'s prophetic writings and speeches underscore his relevance for today. They help us imagine King anew: as a human rights leader whose commitment to unions and an end to poverty was a crucial part of his civil rights agenda. Covering all the civil rights movement highlights-Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Selma, Chicago, and Memphis-award-winning historian Michael K. Honey introduces and traces King\'s dream of economic equality. Gathered in one volume for the first time, the majority of these speeches will be new to most readers. The collection begins with King\'s lectures to unions in the 1960s and includes his addresses during his Poor People\'s Campaign, culminating with his momentous \"Mountaintop\" speech, delivered in support of striking black sanitation workers in Memphis. Unprecedented and timely, \"All Labor Has Dignity\" will more fully restore our understanding of King\'s lasting vision of economic justice, bringing his demand for equality right into the present.

Norton & Company, 2007. The definitive history of the epic struggle for economic justice that became Martin Luther King Jr.\'s last crusade. Memphis in 1968 was ruled by a paternalistic \"plantation mentality\" embodied in its good-old-boy mayor, Henry Loeb. Wretched conditions, abusive white supervisors, poor education, and low wages locked most black workers into poverty. Then two sanitation workers were chewed up like garbage in the back of a faulty truck, igniting a public employee strike that brought to a boil long-simmering issues of racial injustice. With novelistic drama and rich scholarly detail, Michael Honey brings to life the magnetic characters who clashed on the Memphis battlefield: stalwart black workers; fiery black ministers; volatile, young, black-power advocates; idealistic organizers and tough-talking unionists; the first black members of the Memphis city council; the white upper crust who sought to prevent change or conflagration; and, finally, the magisterial Martin Luther King Jr., undertaking a Poor People\'s Campaign at the crossroads of his life, vilified as a subversive, hounded by the FBI, and seeing in the working poor of Memphis his hopes for a better America.

The labor of black workers has been crucial to economic development in the United States. Yet because of racism and segregation, their contribution remains largely unknown. Spanning the 1930s to the present, Black Workers Remember tells the hidden history of African American workers in their own words. It provides striking firsthand accounts of the experiences of black southerners living under segregation in Memphis, Tennessee. Eloquent and personal, these oral histories comprise a unique primary source and provide a new way of understanding the black labor experience during the industrial era. Together, the stories demonstrate how black workers resisted racial apartheid in American industry and underscore the active role of black working people in history. The individual stories are arranged thematically in chapters on labor organizing, Jim Crow in the workplace, police brutality, white union racism, and civil rights struggles. Taken together, the stories ask us to rethink the conventional understanding of the civil rights movement as one led by young people and preachers in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, we see the freedom struggle as the product of generations of people, including workers who organized unions, resisted Jim Crow at work, and built up their families, churches, and communities. The collection also reveals the devastating impact that a globalizing capitalist economy has had on black communities and the importance of organizing the labor movement as an antidote to poverty. Michael Honey gathered these oral histories for more than fifteen years. He weaves them together here into a rich collection reflecting many tragic dimensions of America\'s racial history while drawing new attention to the role of workers and poor people in African American and American history.

Trial by Cash By Christie Thompson The Best Books We Read This Year By The Editors The \'Graywashing\' of CIA Torture By Conor Friedersdorf Why Lefties Make Less By Joe Pinsker \'All Labor Has Dignity\': Martin Luther King, Jr.\'s Fight for Economic Justice Joe Fassler Feb 22 2011, 2:40 PM ET Share on Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print Comments Beacon Press While researching at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta in 1992, Washington University professor Michael Honey found an inconspicuous folder marked \"King\'s Labor Speeches.\" He opened it, and found a trove of King\'s addresses to labor unions and workers\' rights coalitions—most of which had never been published. This discovery led to \"All Labor Has Dignity\": King\'s Speeches on Labor, a collection edited by Honey and released in January by Beacon Press as part of their \"King Legacy\" series. The book shows an eerily prescient Dr. King, a clear-eyed visionary who speaks prophetically about the host of issues facing our nation today. In the eloquent, mythic language for which he is famous, King lambastes economic forces growing the gap between rich and poor, the massive tax resources used for war spending while domestic programs languished, and the knee-jerk demonizing of progressive social reform as \"communist.\" He even criticizes the conservative senators—he calls them \"Neanderthals\"—who abused their filibuster privilege to block meaningful legislative change. The collection demonstrates that historical considerations of Dr. King\'s contributions have overlooked his dogged dedication to the organized labor movement, and his fight on behalf of the working poor across racial divides. I spoke with Honey about King\'s work for workers\' rights, the historical context of the speeches, and the relevance of King\'s conclusions to ongoing 21st-century American labor disputes. How do these speeches collected here help us reevaluate King\'s legacy? The book contains 15 different documents from 1957 to 1968, and they all present a somewhat different side of King that most people don\'t know about. Almost all of these speeches are unknown to the general public. Until recently, King\'s economic justice platform and his relationship with workers and unions has been an almost entirely neglected topic. MORE INTERVIEWS: Eleanor Barkhorn: How Timothy Keller Spreads the Gospel in New York City, and Beyond Eleanor Barkhorn: Behind the Scenes at the Oscars: An Interview With Art Streiber Douglas Gorney: Dreams From Africa: Exploring Barack Obama\'s Kenyan Roots The civil rights movement was not just about civil rights—it was about human rights, and that means labor rights. The book is really about a period when King was trying to use the momentum of the civil rights movement to help the labor movement, the cause of public employee workers, and people in the service economy. And those are the areas where unions have grown tremendously in the last 20 or 30 years—in part because of Dr. King\'s sacrifice in Memphis. Your collection shows King\'s systematic, concerted effort to yoke the predominately black civil rights movement with the predominately white, and sometimes socially conservative, labor movement. Why was this so important to him? You have to ask: Why is he making these speeches in the first place? At that time in our history, there were a lot of very strong unions. He\'s asking them to donate money to the civil rights movement, which was an emerging movement, and he makes an interesting plea: You have a lot more power than we do, but we have the moral agenda—and the attention of the nation that you\'re losing. The business community and the media had been propagating this idea of big labor and union bosses, separating the unions from the workers, making them appear to be corrupt. And there were some corrupt unions. And some unions that were not only ignoring people of color, but totally excluding them. King wanted to convince the unions that the civil rights movement was not only important on its own—but that its success was crucial to the labor movement\'s success, too. In a 1968 speech, King asks: \"What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn\'t earn enough money to buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?\" Had he started to feel that race reform was doomed without economic reform, and vice versa? He did say that the civil rights that we\'d attained from Brown vs. Board of Education to the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts were a remarkable change, but after that he really did emphasize economic issues. The urban areas were exploding all across the country. There were riots, police brutality, and National Guard occupation of black communities. The fact was, in the urban areas, civil rights didn\'t do anything to change the economic situation for the mass of working class people. Those were people that should have had jobs and union wages, who should have been advancing themselves. Instead, factories were shutting down. Jobs were being shipped overseas. The urban areas were being stripped of all economic activities. It was like stranding the millions of people who\'d migrated to the cities for jobs. So, without an economic program—yes, that\'s what he was saying—the civil rights we\'ve gained won\'t be meaningful for most people. From \"All Labor Has Dignity,\" March 18, 1968 Many of these speeches criticize the robustness of the American war machine. King is widely known as a Pacifist and a practitioner of non-violence, a student of Gandhi, but do these speeches give new dimensionality to his critique of violence? There\'s a speech in here, given in 1962, where he says: \"There are three major social evils in our world today: the evil of war, the evil of economic justice, and the evil of racial injustice.\" He goes on to show how these things are linked together, and gives a similar critique throughout the book. He particularly links the problems of poverty and economic injustice to the continuing escalation of war and foreign military intervention—you have to remember, he was giving these speeches in the context of the American invasion of Latin American countries, Vietnam, and the mass bombing in Indo-China. Sure, these efforts created some American jobs, but they also wreaked havoc all over the world. What he\'s saying is this: militarism is not the way to economic prosperity for people in the United States. He saw it as a moral abomination that the U.S. was using its power this way in the world. And he thought it was also creating a nightmare at home. The speeches, and your notes in the book, demonstrate that King often battled accusations that he was Communist—something of an elided historical fact. The big campaign in the South was to frighten away middle-class, white support by calling King a Communist. Anybody who worked on civil rights was called a Communist. And some were. But King was of the opinion that if somebody sincerely supported the civil rights movement, they had a right to their political opinions. He wasn\'t going to turn people away who wanted to work seriously for justice because someone called them a Communist. He was always under attack for that. 1 2 > > Single Page Presented by Jump to Comments Share on Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Email Print Comments Joe Fassler is a writer based in Brooklyn. His fiction has appeared in The Boston Review, and he regularly interviews authors for The Lit Show.

Yet because of racism and segregation, their contribution remains largely unknown. Spanning the 1930s to the present, Black Workers Remember tells the hidden history of African American workers in their own words. It provides striking firsthand accounts of the experiences of black southerners living under segregation in Memphis, Tennessee. Eloquent and personal, these oral histories comprise a unique primary source and provide a new way of understanding the black labor experience during the industrial era. Together, the stories demonstrate how black workers resisted racial apartheid in American industry and underscore the active role of black working people in history. The individual stories are arranged thematically in chapters on labor organizing, Jim Crow in the workplace, police brutality, white union racism, and civil rights struggles. Taken together, the stories ask us to rethink the conventional understanding of the civil rights movement as one led by young people and preachers in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, we see the freedom struggle as the product of generations of people, including workers who organized unions, resisted Jim Crow at work, and built up their families, churches, and communities. The collection also reveals the devastating impact that a globalizing capitalist economy has had on black communities and the importance of organizing the labor movement as an antidote to poverty. Michael Honey gathered these oral histories for more than fifteen years. He weaves them together here into a rich collection reflecting many tragic dimensions of America\'s racial history while drawing new attention to the role of workers and poor people in African American and American history.

Poignant reading, Honey\'s interviews reflect his clear sympathy and admiration for his subjects and their achievements. No one can read these stories without sharing Honey\'s feelings.\" - Gerald Friedman, Journal of Economic History \"[An] eloquent history....

By David Domkoski on January 17, 2001 Format: Hardcover The Murray Morgan Prize is awarded annually by the Tacoma Public Library to an outstanding Washington author in recognition of a work published during the previous year that is of high literary quality and wide interest. The work must exemplify the principles of narrative excellence and high standards of research as demonstrated in the distinguished career of author, historian, journalist and educator Murray Morgan. \"Black Workers Remember expands what we know of the Civil Rights Movement,\" explained Jack Bregger, a member of the Murray Morgan Prize Selection Committee. \"Through the voices and stories of the African American men and women who worked in Memphis, Tennessee\'s factories, Honey tells of a struggle for freedom that spans the 20th century -- a story which until now was all but invisible. Michael Honey effectively places these moving personal accounts in the more powerful context of social upheaval and, in a sense, cultural revolution. It insists, as Honey writes in the book\'s Preface, that we think \'about what it means to be poor, black, and working class, and to recognize the unfinished character of the struggle for racial and economic justice in our own time\'. The ultimate success of this extraordinary book can be found in its intimacy and immediacy. The book shook me right down to my very core, and I know it did the same to other committee members.\" Comment Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Sending feedback... Thank you for your feedback.

Through the voices and stories of the black men and women who worked in Memphis, Tennessee\'s factories, Honey reveals a struggle for freedom that spans the 20th century. It shows the conditions that blacks faced in the 30\'s as they moved from farm work to factory work and their struggles to challenge Jim Crow in the factories, in unions, and in the community. This book is being honored by the Lillian Smith Book Award, the oldest literary award in the American South, and it offers a great deal to the current scholarship on Southern struggles for civil and human rights.

By \"schiefeliz\" on March 14, 2002 Format: Paperback As a black female, I was excited to finally read Michael Honey\'s book. However, it turned out to be a major disappointment. Honey\'s extremely slanted view skews history to the extent that most readers will be turned off by this work. Honey totally discounts the importance unions had in achieving equality for blacks, a major blunder according to any historian. While Honey has a great grasp of the English language, his book should not be counted on for accuracy. Readers will find, after researching other literature, Honey\'s arguments should not be repeated. Save yourself some time and pass on this book. Comment Was this review helpful to you?

Honey is an American historian, Guggenheim Fellow and Haley Professor of Humanities at the University of Washington Tacoma in the United States, where he teaches African-American, civil rights and labor history.[1][2] He previously served as the Harry Bridges Chair of Labor Studies for the University of Washington, and as President of the Labor and Working-Class History Association.[2] Honey is best known for his scholarly research on the history of the American civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr., and on the labor history of the United States. In 2011 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, \"on the basis of his prior achievement and exceptional promise\", from a field of almost 3,000 applicants from the United States and Canada.[3][4] He has also received research grants and fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Humanities Center, the Rockefeller Foundation\'s Bellagio Research and Conference Center, the Huntington Library, and the Stanford Humanities Center.[2] Honey is a graduate of Northern Illinois University (Ph.D.), Howard University (M.A.) and Oakland University (B.A.). In 2008 his book Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King\'s Last Campaign won the Liberty Legacy Foundation Award, awarded annually for the best book written by a professional historian on the fights for civil rights in the United States anytime from 1776 to the present.[5] It also received the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights 2011 Book award given annually to a novelist who \"most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy\'s purposes - his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity.\"[6] His current work is on the oral history of John Handcox, a Great Depression-era tenant farmer from Arkansas and advocate for the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, known for his political songs and poetry.[7] Selected works[edit] Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights: Organizing Memphis Workers (1993) ISBN 978-0-252-06305-3 \"Black Workers Remember: An Oral History of Segregation, Unionism, and the Freedom Struggle (1999) ISBN 0-520-21774-8 Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King\'s Last Campaign (2008) ISBN 978-0-393-33053-3 All Labor Has Dignity (ed., 2011) ISBN 978-0-8070-8600-1, Martin Luther King\'s speeches on labor rights and economic justice, in the King Legacy Series of Beacon Press References[edit] ^ \"Michael Honey\".

Over the first few decades of the twentieth century, he survived attempted lynchings, floods, droughts, and the ravages of the Great Depression to organize black and white farmers alike on behalf of the Southern Tenant Farmers\' Union. He also became one of the most beloved folk singers of the prewar labor movement, composing songs such as \"Roll the Union On\" and \"There Is Mean Things Happening in this Land\" that bridged racial divides and kept the spirits of striking workers high. Though he withdrew from the public eye for nearly forty years, missing the \"folk boom\" of the 1960s, he resurfaced decades later - just in time to denounce the policies of the Reagan administration in song - and his work was embraced by new generations of labor activists and folk music devotees. Michael Honey\'s fascinating and beautifully told history gives us John Handcox in his own words, recounting a journey that began in a sharecropper\'s shack in the Deep South and went on to shape the labor music tradition, all amid the tangled and troubled history of the United States in the twentieth century.

Editorial Reviews Review \'John\'s story will not be forgotten, now that Michael Honey has got it down on paper. As long as human beings like to sing...I believe his songs will live on. In that sense, John will never die.\' - Pete Seeger, from the Foreword \"A deeply moving account of the life and struggles of John Handcox who became known as \'the sharecropper\'s troubadour\' for the songs he wrote and sang at union meetings in Arkansas, Mississippi, and throughout the nation. Honey\'s book is essential reading to understand the history of labor and black music in the rural south.\" - William Ferris, author of The Storied South: Voices of Writers and Artists \"John L. Handcox, the unsung radical guitar-strumming storyteller, has finally found the person to tell his story. Michael Honey not only paints a lyrical portrait of Handcox but delivers a powerful history of a people, a movement, and a culture that birthed the Freedom Songs of the modern era.\" - Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original \"An arresting account of the exemplary life of an American genius. Honey\'s and Handcox\'s voices mix in a unique combination of oral history and scholarly research that reminds us of the centrality of music, and of poetry, to US freedom movements.\" - David Roediger, co-author of The Production of Difference About the Author Michael Honey is the Fred T. and Dorothy G. Haley Endowed Professor of the Humanities at The University of Washington, USA, and was a 2011 Guggenheim fellow.

But more important, this is an indepth history of the Southern Tenant Farmers\' Union, a brave attempt to organize white and black sharecroppers in the late 1930s, who faced terrible hardships and violence. While the New Deal might have helped many, it did not help the tenant farmers, both white and black, in the South, who did not benefit from the government\'s farm subsidies. Handcox\'s songs are still performed today for labor and civil rights organizing. Comment Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Sending feedback... Thank you for your feedback.

Please try again Honey tells unjustly ignored story - editor screws him over with inexcusable typos By Josh on October 13, 2014 Format: Paperback Verified Purchase Michael K. Honey brings to light a story that simply hasn\'t been told enough. Arkansas may be the murky dark of conservative politics these days, but in the Depression Era, it happened to be a hot bed of social progressivism. The Southern Tenant Farmers\' Union began in Tyronza in 1934 and was arguably the most successful Agricultural union in America. It lasted into the seventies, though it peaked only for its first four years of existence (which shows how difficult it is to organize farm labor). Through those four years, a black man vigorously organized for the union, his name was John L. Handcox. He had a fourth grade education and the little money he had he scratched out of the ground in the Mississippi River Delta. What he should be heralded for though, are the songs and poems that he wrote and performed with the purpose of organizing sharecroppers. Charles Seeger recorded Handcox\' songs for he Library of Congress in the thirties, though they were largely ignored until the peak of the folk revival. Seeger\'s record, however, shows that Handcox was part of a group of traditional musicians who were responsible for the revival in the first place. Honey interviewed Handcox at length in the eighties, and a good portion of the book comes from these oral accounts, the rest is meticulously researched. Unfortunately for Honey, his editor or publisher allowed several typos, missing words, and repeated words into the text. They really did a disservice to an otherwise well-written book. The professionalism just isn\'t there in the editing. Comment Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Sending feedback... Thank you for your feedback.

Yet because of racism and segregation, their contribution remains largely unknown. Spanning the 1930s to the present, Black Workers Remember tells the hidden history of African American workers in their own words. It provides striking firsthand accounts of the experiences of black southerners living under segregation in Memphis, Tennessee. Eloquent and personal, these oral histories comprise a unique primary source and provide a new way of understanding the black labor experience during the industrial era. Together, the stories demonstrate how black workers resisted racial apartheid in American industry and underscore the active role of black working people in history. The individual stories are arranged thematically in chapters on labor organizing, Jim Crow in the workplace, police brutality, white union racism, and civil rights struggles. Taken together, the stories ask us to rethink the conventional understanding of the civil rights movement as one led by young people and preachers in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, we see the freedom struggle as the product of generations of people, including workers who organized unions, resisted Jim Crow at work, and built up their families, churches, and communities. The collection also reveals the devastating impact that a globalizing capitalist economy has had on black communities and the importance of organizing the labor movement as an antidote to poverty. Michael Honey gathered these oral histories for more than fifteen years. He weaves them together here into a rich collection reflecting many tragic dimensions of America\'s racial history while drawing new attention to the role of workers and poor people in African American and American history. Michael Keith Honey is Harry Bridges Chair of Labor Studies and Professor of African-American, Ethnic and Labor Studies, and American History at the University of Washington, Tacoma. He is the author of the prize-winning Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights: Organizing Memphis Workers (1993). Murray Morgan Prize 2000, Tacoma Public Library H. L.

More importantly, because encyclopedias often cover the major issues surrounding the subect, they can help you narrow your research from a broad who, what, where, when topic to a how or why question. In addition many encyclopedia articles include short bibliographies that will lead you to the major works on the topic.

His previous books include “Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King’s Last Campaign” in 2007  and “All Labor Has Dignity,” in 2010. His new book, “Sharecropper’s Troubadour: John L. Handcox, the Southern Tenant Farmers Union and the African American Song Tradition” was published in November by Palgrave Macmillan. He answered a few questions about the book for UW Today. Q: What’s the concept behind this book? A: The book is about the power of song and the human spirit. John Handcox, born in eastern Arkansas in 1904, grew up at one of the worst times and in one of the worst places to be black in America. He used his African-American song traditions to help desperately poor white and black agricultural workers organize together in Ku Klux Klan country during the Great Depression. They created one of the most remarkable social movements in American history. John showed that music is a powerful force to unite people for change. Q: How did you come to write about John Handcox? A: Folklorist and musician Pete Seeger introduced me to John in 1985 at a labor arts forum held outside of Washington, D.C. Ralph Rinzler, the director of the folklife program at the Smithsonian Institution, asked me to interview John about his life and music. The rest, as they say, is history. Michael Honey Q: You write, “Much as rap artists did in later years, John weaponized the spoken word.” It’s a powerful phrase — would you expand on your meaning? John painted word pictures to help people to see their plight and do something about it. He wrote: “The planter lives off the sweat of the sharecropper’s brow, How the sharecropper lives, the planter cares not how. The Sharecropper works and he toils and sweats, The planter brings him out in debt. Planter what the heaven is the matter with you? What has your labor ever done to you? Upon his back you just sit and ride. Don’t you think your labor gonna ever get tired?” Hear John L. Handcox Listen to the songs of John Handcox and Michael Honey describing the book at Honey’s website. Hear Mike Honey Honey will talk about “Sharecropper’s Troubadour” in coming weeks. Feb. 12: 7 p.m., Tacoma Public Library. Feb. 13: 12:30 p.m., William Phillip Hall, UW Tacoma March 13: 7 p.m., University Bookstore Seattle Q: Handcox disappeared from public life for decades. What were the circumstances of his departure and his return? A: Plantation holders and their henchmen gathered a lynch mob to get him and John wanted to shoot it out, but his mother convinced him that the whole family would be killed if he did. John fled Arkansas for Memphis in 1937 and began writing songs. He became a traveling organizer, poet, singer and songwriter for the Southern Tenant Farmers’ Union.  Jail, arrests, beatings and murder destroyed the union. John and his family went west to San Diego, and people in the union movement thought he had died. He worked as a carpenter and selling produce from his backyard until folklorists rediscovered him nearly 50 years later. Q: You quote Handcox late in life saying, “What workers need today is more unity and less union.” What caused this comment from him, and what is its meaning? Did it signal a change in his overall attitude toward unions? A: To maintain the privileges of white workers, the carpenters union in San Diego first excluded him from work and then made him work at lower pay, until he broke down their barriers of racial discrimination. “More unity and less union” is what he demanded. The existence of racial discrimination in the work world did not dim John’s support for unions — quite the contrary — and he continued to sing “Solidarity Forever” as well as his composition, “Roll the Union On.” Q: Finally, what do you hope will be the legacy of John Handcox, assisted by this book? A: John Handcox wanted us to remember and celebrate the fact that people can unite even under the worst of conditions and that song can help them to do it. His life and his songs and poems stand as a testament to this fact. Even as multinational corporations make inordinate profits by driving down the wages and living standards of workers today, it is always possible, John believed, “to make this a better world.” Watch a video of John Handcox talking and singing “I Live On.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Email Print Tagged with: labor history, Michael Honey, University of Washington Tacoma Most popular Warmer Pacific Ocean could release millions of tons of seafloor methane 6K views \'Mirage Earth\' exoplanets may have burned away chances for life 4K views Automated age-progression software lets you see how a child will age 3K views \'What is HCDE?\' New comics class aims to answer the question 2K views Latest news Arts Roundup: Exhibitions, drama — and ‘An Appalachian Christmas’ 1 day ago Warmer Pacific Ocean could release millions of tons of seafloor methane 2 days ago Music meets history in three-concert series on World War I 1 week ago Arts Roundup: Lectures, music — and UW Symphony and Opera Theater 1 week ago Search UW Today Search for: Browse Categories Select Category Administrative Affairs Archive Arts and Entertainment Buildings and Grounds Education Engineering Environment For UW Employees Health and Medicine Honors and Awards Learning News Releases News Roundups Politics and Government Profiles Research Science Social Science Technology Uncategorized UW and the Community Campus Publications A&S Perspectives College of Education Columns Magazine The Daily More publications Evans School Foster School of Business Health Sciences/Medicine News Information School IT Connect News Law School News School of Dentistry School of Nursing School of Pharmacy School of Public Health School of Social Work UW Autism Center UW Libraries: News & Events UW Medicine Online News UWTV Washington Engineer Viewpoints E-NEWS Your email address Daily Weekly Roundup University of Washington Be boundless Connect with us: Facebook Twitter Instagram Tumblr YouTube LinkedIn Pinterest Vine Google+ Accessibility Contact Us Jobs Campus Safety My UW Rules Docket Privacy Terms © 2014 University of Washington | Seattle, WA Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

The venerated civil rights leader is best remembered for his fearless commitment to non-violence in the struggle for racial equality. However the pursuit of racial justice was interrelated with the pursuit of a more just society in many arenas, including that of workers’ rights. King was killed while traveling in Memphis in support of a historic strike of the city’s black sanitation workers. The men were paid less than their white counterparts, endured dangerous working conditions, and were being denied the right to join a union. Forty-three years later gains made by labor since the days of Martin Luther King are being rolled back by city and state governments nationwide. Elected officials are saying the deep recession justifies the decimation of collective bargaining rights. Additionally public employees are being asked to tighten their belts through a wide range of measures, including unpaid furlough days, pay freezes and cuts in health benefits. As in King’s time workers of color remain particularly disadvantaged by labor troubles. Nationally, in February, 8% of whites were unemployed compared to 15.3% of blacks. Addressing the striking sanitation workers King spoke of the “dignity of labor” in a speech that he gave on March 18th, just days before he was assassinated.

Haley Endowed Professor of the Humanities and Professor, Labor and Ethnic Studies and American History at the University of Washington, Tacoma, and author of, Going Down Jericho Road, the Memphis Strike and Martin Luther King’s Last Campaign Read Dr. Honey’s recent article “King’s Fight for Unions Is Still Essential.” No responses yet Comments RSS Leave a Reply Name (required) Mail (hidden) (required) Website Sign up for Our Daily Digest Past Shows Dec 10 2014 - Profesor John A.

He fought throughout his life to connect the labor and civil rights movements, envisioning them as twin pillars for social reform. As we struggle with massive unemployment, a staggering racial wealth gap, and the near collapse of a financial system that puts profits before people, King’s prophetic writings and speeches underscore his relevance for today. They help us imagine King anew: as a human rights leader whose commitment to unions and an end to poverty was a crucial part of his civil rights agenda.   Covering all the civil rights movement highlights—Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Selma, Chicago, and Memphis—award-winning historian Michael K. Honey introduces and traces King’s dream of economic equality. Gathered in one volume for the first time, the majority of these speeches will be new to most readers. The collection begins with King’s lectures to unions in the 1960s and includes his addresses during his Poor People’s Campaign, culminating with his momentous “Mountaintop” speech, delivered in support of striking black sanitation workers in Memphis. Unprecedented and timely, “All Labor Has Dignity” will more fully restore our understanding of King’s lasting vision of economic justice, bringing his demand for equality right into the present.   Read more Read less Special Offers and Product Promotions Get a $150 Amazon.com Gift Card: Get the Citi ThankYou® Preferred Card and earn a $150.00 digital Amazon.com Gift Card* after $1,000 in card purchases within 3 months of account opening.

Editorial Reviews From Booklist King was in the midst of cultivating an alliance between the civil rights movement and labor unions when he was assassinated in 1968. He was in Memphis to support a strike by black sanitation workers and was planning the Poor People’s Campaign, advocating for jobs, unionization, and dignity for all workers. Despite the sometimes prickly relationship between African Americans and unions with members eager to protect jobs by discrimination, King made substantial inroads with many union leaders. Honey, scholar and former civil rights organizer, offers a collection of 15 of King’s speeches (12 previously unpublished) on workers’ rights. Drawing on archival material from the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Honey reforms King’s image from civil rights activist to labor activist. In speeches delivered in venues including a 1961 AFL-CIO convention in Miami and a meeting with Teamsters in New York in 1967, King’s words put into perspective the labor movement since the 1930s and its links to the civil rights movement via such similar tactics as sit-ins, boycotts, and strikes. This important collection broadens our perception of King’s vision of social justice. --Vanessa Bush Review “King was always a champion for labor rights and economic justice, and this volume illustrates that dimension of his leadership. Preceding each carefully transcribed speech, a brief essay by Honey puts King’s words into context. …Highly recommended.”—Choice Magazine “Michael Honey, a distinguished scholar of labor and African-American History, has done a great service by gathering Martin Luther King, Jr.’s speeches on labor, may of them previously unknown.  He brings to life the King who from the outset of his public career insisted that “the evil of economic injustice” must be combated along with racial inequality, and who saw the effort to eliminate poverty as a natural outgrowth of the civil rights struggle. This is a more complex King than we celebrate every January, forever frozen on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial delivering his “I Have a Dream Speech.”  King’s dream called for nothing less than a radical restructuring of American economic life.”—Eric Foner, DeWitt Clinton Professor of History, Columbia University   “Thanks to Michael Honey’s meticulous editing and the inclusion of rarely heard audio, we can finally grasp the depth of the Reverend Martin Luther King’s commitment to Americans as workers. Now, more than ever, his insights show us the way of transformation from consumers divided by race and ethnicity into an active, united citizenry.”—Nell Irvin Painter, author of The History of White People and Edwards Professor of American History, Emerita, Princeton University   “This is more than a compelling and unprecedented collection of speeches by Martin Luther King, Jr. Through thoughtful introductions to each and every speech, Honey sets the stage for the reader, proving without a doubt that Dr. King was among the greatest labor leaders of the 20th century and that his message continues to resonate powerfully in our age.”—Bill Fletcher, Jr., Editorial Board, BlackCommentator.com; co-founder, Center for Labor Renewal; Board Chairperson, International Labor Rights   “As this powerful and inspiring collection shows, Dr. King was a tireless champion of the working class. But “All Labor Has Dignity” is not just a testament to his rhetorical legacy—it is a call to action.”—Richard L. Trumka, president, AFL-CIO “All Labor Has Dignity is an illuminating argument that King was concerned with much, much more than just the plight of black people. His public career may have started in that arena, but it ended with him as a champion for progressives around the globe.”—Pop Matters See all Editorial Reviews More About the Authors Discover books, learn about writers, read author blogs, and more.

In today\'s modern era of unemployment, a widening gap between rich and poor, increasingly stark wealth divides along racial lines, and the near-destruction of our financial system due to the machinations of those who put bottom line profits not only above individuals, but also above the economic stability of the entire nation, Dr. King\'s words are more timely and relevant than ever. \"All Labor Has Dignity\" includes King\'s lectures to unions in the 1960s, his addresses during the Poor People\'s Campaign, and his notable \"Mountaintop\" speech given on behalf of striking black sanitation workers in Memphis. An introduction, epilogue, and index by editor Michael K. Honey round out this superb addition to social issues shelves, and an accompanying audio CD allows one to listen to two of King\'s speeches: \"The Unresolved Race Question\" and \"All Labor Has Dignity\". Highly recommended. Comment Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Sending feedback... Thank you for your feedback. If this review is inappropriate, please let us know.

Courtesy of W. W. Norton & Company hide caption itoggle caption Courtesy of W. W. Norton & Company Although many people know that Martin Luther King Jr. died in Memphis, many don\'t know that King had come to the city on behalf of black sanitation workers who were striking for the right to unionize. The strikers and their supporters turned Memphis upside down for 65 days in the winter of 1968. King saw his work in Memphis as part of a new direction in the civil rights movement, emphasizing economic equality. \"We know that it isn\'t enough to integrate lunch counters,\" King told a crowd at Mason Temple in March 1968. \"What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn\'t earn enough money to buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?\" Historian Michael Honey joins Fresh Air to discuss King\'s involvement in the Memphis labor campaign, which he covered in his book, Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King\'s Last Campaign. Honey is a former civil liberties organizer and a professor of ethics, gender and labor studies and American history at the University of Washington, Tacoma.

Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed in Memphis, Tenn. He was there to lend his support to sanitation workers — most of them African American — who were on strike, protesting terrible working conditions and low wages. Taylor Rogers and Elmore Nickelberry were among the 1,300 who walked off the job in 1968. Rogers remembers picking up tubs of garbage that were full of holes. \"That garbage would leak all over you,\" he says. By the time he got home, his clothes were dirty and full of maggots that had fallen on him. \"I had maggots run down in my shirts, and then maggots would go down in my shoes,\" Nickelberry says. \"And we worked in the rain — snow, ice and rain. We had to. If we didn\'t, we\'d lose our job. They said, \'A garbage man wasn\'t nothing.\'\" Rogers says, \"It was awful.\" One day, two workers, who had gone into a trash compactor to escape the rain, were crushed to death. \"Sometimes you cry,\" Nickelberry says. \"Sometimes you get mad and get up in the morning and ... say, \'I ain\'t going to work.\' ... I had to work because that\'s the only way I could feed my family.\" \'All We Wanted Was Some Dignity\' \"All we wanted was some decency, some dignity,\" Rogers says. \"We wanted to be treated as men. So we said that this is it. Thirteen hundred sanitation workers, we all decided that we wasn\'t going to take no more. \"You know, if you bend your back, people will ride your back. But if you stand up straight, people can\'t ride your back. So that\'s what we did. We stood up straight and said, \'I am a man.\'\" \'I\'ve Been to the Mountaintop\' Rogers and his wife, Bessie, were both at Mason Temple on April 3, 1968, when King delivered what would prove to be his final speech. \"It was wall to wall with people,\" Taylor Rogers says. Taylor and Bessie Rogers remember King\'s memorable passage: \"Well, I don\'t know what will happen now. We\'ve got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn\'t matter with me now, because I\'ve been to the mountaintop. ... And I\'ve looked over, and I\'ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.\" \"He was crying,\" Bessie Rogers says. \"Tears were rolling down his cheek.\" Taylor Rogers adds, \"Preachers were crying, people were crying, and everybody was crying.\" \"He really talked that night,\" Bessie Rogers says. \"He really, really talked.\" \"You could really tell by the expression on his face, the feeling and the sound of his voice that he knew something was going to happen,\" Taylor Rogers says. \"I\'m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord,\" King said. The civil rights leader was assassinated the following day. \"You know, it\'s kind of like you lost a part of your family,\" Taylor Rogers says. \"You just really can\'t describe it. \"He put everything aside to come to Memphis to see about the people on the bottom of the ladder — the sanitation workers,\" Taylor Rogers says. \"After his death, we marched. You couldn\'t hear a sound ... you couldn\'t hear nothing but leather against pavement. \"It was just some terrible days back then, but with God\'s help we came through and it means something to know that you were a part of this.\" Produced for Morning Edition by Michael Garofalo and Selly Thiam, with help from Steven Thrasher.

He teaches African-American, civil rights and labor history and specializes in work on Martin Luther King, Jr. Honey holds the Fred T. and Dorothy G. Haley Endowed Professorship in the Humanities at the University of Washington, Tacoma (UWT) and previously served as the Harry Bridges Chair of Labor Studies for the University of Washington and as President of the Labor and Working-Class History Association. Honey\'s work is noted for his extensive use of oral history, deep archival research, and vibrant writing style. The History Book Club called Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King\'s Last Campaign (W.W. Norton, 2007), \"a truly great book\" and Cornell West deemed it a \"magisterial treatment.\" It won awards from the Robert F. Kennedy Book Foundation, the Organization of American Historians, the Southern Historical Association, and the United Association of Labor Educators. Honey won the University of Washington, Tacoma\'s Distinguished Research award and the Weyerhaueser Foundation\'s Martin Luther King Award for community leadership and service. Honey\'s collection of King\'s labor and economic justice speeches, titled All Labor Has Dignity (Beacon Press, 2011) is endorsed by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka as \"powerful and inspiring\" and not just a testament to King\'s rhetorical legacy but \"a call to action.\" Honey\'s previous award-winning books proved path breaking in linking labor and civil rights histories. Black Workers Remember: An Oral History of Unionism, Segregation and the Freedom Struggle (University of California Press, 1999 was called \"poignant reading\" by economist Gerald Friedman and \"eloquent\" by historian Bruce Nelson. Many consider his first book, Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights: Organizing Memphis Workers (University of Illinois Press, 1993), a classic and a journal reviewer deemed it \"among the best and most ambitious recent works on labor in the South.\" A southern civil rights and civil liberties organizer from 1970-1976, Honey links scholarship, music, and public speaking with community and labor organizing. He performed his \"Links on the Chain\" labor and civil rights songs with Pete Seeger, Bettie Mae Fikes and other freedom singers and he has given invited lectures before numerous campus and community organizations (the University of Florida, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Louisville, Northwestern and Seattle Universities, the University of Illinois, Northern Illinois University, the National Labor College, and the AFL-CIO among others). As a founding faculty member at the University of Washington, Tacoma (1990), Honey helped shape the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences program and its Ethnic, Gender and Labor studies major. Students in his Tacoma Oral and Community History project have produced scores of personal histories that are archived and online. His \"Underdog Productions\" produced short films including one on war resister Lt. Ehren Watada. Honey has received numerous research grants and fellowships from scholarly organizations. These include the American Council of Learned Societies, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Humanities Center, the Rockefeller Foundation\'s Bellagio Research and Conference Center, the Huntington Library, and the Stanford Humanities Center. He has published many scholarly articles in books and journals as well as columns on current issues in mass media (including the Nation, the Seattle Times and Post-Intelligencer, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, the Tacoma News Tribune, the Progressive, the History News Network). Honey is a graduate of Northern Illinois University (Ph.D.), Howard University (M.A.) and Oakland University (B.A.). He lives in Tacoma with his wife Pat Krueger, a professor of music education at the University of Puget Sound.

Refer to the Curriculum Vitae for full details of his scholarly work. Sharecropper\'s Troubadour Descended from African American slaves, Native Americans, and white slaveowners, John Handcox was born to a family of poor Arkansas sharecroppers at one of the hardest times to be black in America. Over the first few decades of the twentieth century, he survived attempted lynchings, floods, droughts, and the ravages of the Great Depression to organize black and white farmers alike on behalf of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. He also became one of the most beloved folk singers of the prewar labor movement, composing songs such as \"Roll the Union On\" and \"There Is Mean Things Happening in this Land\" that bridged racial divides and kept the spirits of striking workers high. Though he withdrew from the public eye for nearly forty years, missing the \"folk boom\" of the 1960s, he resurfaced decades later - just in time to denounce the policies of the Reagan administration in song - and his work was embraced by new generations of labor activists and folk music devotees. This fascinating and beautifully told oral history gives us John Handcox in his own words, recounting a journey that began in a sharecropper\'s shack in the Deep South and went on to shape the labor music tradition, all amid the tangled and troubled history of the United States in the twentieth century. \"A deeply moving account of the life and struggles of John Handcox who became known as \'the sharecropper\'s troubadour\' for the songs he wrote and sang at union meetings in Arkansas, Mississippi, and throughout the nation. Honey\'s book is essential reading to understand the history of labor and black music in the rural south.\"   --William Ferris, author of The Storied South: Voices of Writers and Artists \"An arresting account of the exemplary life of an American genius. Honey\'s and Handcox\'s voices mix in a unique combination of oral history and scholarly research that reminds us of the centrality of music, and of poetry, to US freedom movements.\"   --David Roediger, coauthor of The Production of Difference Videos I Live On Freedom After While Information Facebook Page Click here to order the book Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 1 Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 2 UW Today Article Music (Click a song on the playlist below) \"All Labor Has Dignity\" Beacon Press, 2011. People forget that Dr. King was every bit as committed to economic justice as he was to ending racial segregation. He fought throughout his life to connect the labor and civil rights movements, envisioning them as twin pillars for social reform. As we struggle with massive unemployment, a staggering racial wealth gap, and the near collapse of a financial system that puts profits before people, King\'s prophetic writings and speeches underscore his relevance for today. They help us imagine King anew: as a human rights leader whose commitment to unions and an end to poverty was a crucial part of his civil rights agenda. Covering all the civil rights movement highlights-Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Selma, Chicago, and Memphis-award-winning historian Michael K. Honey introduces and traces King\'s dream of economic equality. Gathered in one volume for the first time, the majority of these speeches will be new to most readers. The collection begins with King\'s lectures to unions in the 1960s and includes his addresses during his Poor People\'s Campaign, culminating with his momentous \"Mountaintop\" speech, delivered in support of striking black sanitation workers in Memphis. Unprecedented and timely, \"All Labor Has Dignity\" will more fully restore our understanding of King\'s lasting vision of economic justice, bringing his demand for equality right into the present.

Norton & Company, 2007. The definitive history of the epic struggle for economic justice that became Martin Luther King Jr.\'s last crusade. Memphis in 1968 was ruled by a paternalistic \"plantation mentality\" embodied in its good-old-boy mayor, Henry Loeb. Wretched conditions, abusive white supervisors, poor education, and low wages locked most black workers into poverty. Then two sanitation workers were chewed up like garbage in the back of a faulty truck, igniting a public employee strike that brought to a boil long-simmering issues of racial injustice. With novelistic drama and rich scholarly detail, Michael Honey brings to life the magnetic characters who clashed on the Memphis battlefield: stalwart black workers; fiery black ministers; volatile, young, black-power advocates; idealistic organizers and tough-talking unionists; the first black members of the Memphis city council; the white upper crust who sought to prevent change or conflagration; and, finally, the magisterial Martin Luther King Jr., undertaking a Poor People\'s Campaign at the crossroads of his life, vilified as a subversive, hounded by the FBI, and seeing in the working poor of Memphis his hopes for a better America.

The labor of black workers has been crucial to economic development in the United States. Yet because of racism and segregation, their contribution remains largely unknown. Spanning the 1930s to the present, Black Workers Remember tells the hidden history of African American workers in their own words. It provides striking firsthand accounts of the experiences of black southerners living under segregation in Memphis, Tennessee. Eloquent and personal, these oral histories comprise a unique primary source and provide a new way of understanding the black labor experience during the industrial era. Together, the stories demonstrate how black workers resisted racial apartheid in American industry and underscore the active role of black working people in history. The individual stories are arranged thematically in chapters on labor organizing, Jim Crow in the workplace, police brutality, white union racism, and civil rights struggles. Taken together, the stories ask us to rethink the conventional understanding of the civil rights movement as one led by young people and preachers in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, we see the freedom struggle as the product of generations of people, including workers who organized unions, resisted Jim Crow at work, and built up their families, churches, and communities. The collection also reveals the devastating impact that a globalizing capitalist economy has had on black communities and the importance of organizing the labor movement as an antidote to poverty. Michael Honey gathered these oral histories for more than fifteen years. He weaves them together here into a rich collection reflecting many tragic dimensions of America\'s racial history while drawing new attention to the role of workers and poor people in African American and American history.

He teaches African-American, civil rights and labor history and specializes in work on Martin Luther King, Jr. Honey holds the Fred T. and Dorothy G. Haley Endowed Professorship in the Humanities at the University of Washington, Tacoma (UWT) and previously served as the Harry Bridges Chair of Labor Studies for the University of Washington and as President of the Labor and Working-Class History Association. Honey\'s work is noted for his extensive use of oral history, deep archival research, and vibrant writing style. The History Book Club called Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King\'s Last Campaign (W.W. Norton, 2007), \"a truly great book\" and Cornell West deemed it a \"magisterial treatment.\" It won awards from the Robert F. Kennedy Book Foundation, the Organization of American Historians, the Southern Historical Association, and the United Association of Labor Educators. Honey won the University of Washington, Tacoma\'s Distinguished Research award and the Weyerhaueser Foundation\'s Martin Luther King Award for community leadership and service. Honey\'s collection of King\'s labor and economic justice speeches, titled All Labor Has Dignity (Beacon Press, 2011) is endorsed by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka as \"powerful and inspiring\" and not just a testament to King\'s rhetorical legacy but \"a call to action.\" Honey\'s previous award-winning books proved path breaking in linking labor and civil rights histories. Black Workers Remember: An Oral History of Unionism, Segregation and the Freedom Struggle (University of California Press, 1999 was called \"poignant reading\" by economist Gerald Friedman and \"eloquent\" by historian Bruce Nelson. Many consider his first book, Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights: Organizing Memphis Workers (University of Illinois Press, 1993), a classic and a journal reviewer deemed it \"among the best and most ambitious recent works on labor in the South.\" A southern civil rights and civil liberties organizer from 1970-1976, Honey links scholarship, music, and public speaking with community and labor organizing. He performed his \"Links on the Chain\" labor and civil rights songs with Pete Seeger, Bettie Mae Fikes and other freedom singers and he has given invited lectures before numerous campus and community organizations (the University of Florida, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Louisville, Northwestern and Seattle Universities, the University of Illinois, Northern Illinois University, the National Labor College, and the AFL-CIO among others). As a founding faculty member at the University of Washington, Tacoma (1990), Honey helped shape the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences program and its Ethnic, Gender and Labor studies major. Students in his Tacoma Oral and Community History project have produced scores of personal histories that are archived and online. His \"Underdog Productions\" produced short films including one on war resister Lt. Ehren Watada. Honey has received numerous research grants and fellowships from scholarly organizations. These include the American Council of Learned Societies, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Humanities Center, the Rockefeller Foundation\'s Bellagio Research and Conference Center, the Huntington Library, and the Stanford Humanities Center. He has published many scholarly articles in books and journals as well as columns on current issues in mass media (including the Nation, the Seattle Times and Post-Intelligencer, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, the Tacoma News Tribune, the Progressive, the History News Network). Honey is a graduate of Northern Illinois University (Ph.D.), Howard University (M.A.) and Oakland University (B.A.). He lives in Tacoma with his wife Pat Krueger, a professor of music education at the University of Puget Sound.

Refer to the Curriculum Vitae for full details of his scholarly work. Sharecropper\'s Troubadour Descended from African American slaves, Native Americans, and white slaveowners, John Handcox was born to a family of poor Arkansas sharecroppers at one of the hardest times to be black in America. Over the first few decades of the twentieth century, he survived attempted lynchings, floods, droughts, and the ravages of the Great Depression to organize black and white farmers alike on behalf of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. He also became one of the most beloved folk singers of the prewar labor movement, composing songs such as \"Roll the Union On\" and \"There Is Mean Things Happening in this Land\" that bridged racial divides and kept the spirits of striking workers high. Though he withdrew from the public eye for nearly forty years, missing the \"folk boom\" of the 1960s, he resurfaced decades later - just in time to denounce the policies of the Reagan administration in song - and his work was embraced by new generations of labor activists and folk music devotees. This fascinating and beautifully told oral history gives us John Handcox in his own words, recounting a journey that began in a sharecropper\'s shack in the Deep South and went on to shape the labor music tradition, all amid the tangled and troubled history of the United States in the twentieth century. \"A deeply moving account of the life and struggles of John Handcox who became known as \'the sharecropper\'s troubadour\' for the songs he wrote and sang at union meetings in Arkansas, Mississippi, and throughout the nation. Honey\'s book is essential reading to understand the history of labor and black music in the rural south.\"   --William Ferris, author of The Storied South: Voices of Writers and Artists \"An arresting account of the exemplary life of an American genius. Honey\'s and Handcox\'s voices mix in a unique combination of oral history and scholarly research that reminds us of the centrality of music, and of poetry, to US freedom movements.\"   --David Roediger, coauthor of The Production of Difference Videos I Live On Freedom After While Information Facebook Page Click here to order the book Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 1 Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 2 UW Today Article Music (Click a song on the playlist below) \"All Labor Has Dignity\" Beacon Press, 2011. People forget that Dr. King was every bit as committed to economic justice as he was to ending racial segregation. He fought throughout his life to connect the labor and civil rights movements, envisioning them as twin pillars for social reform. As we struggle with massive unemployment, a staggering racial wealth gap, and the near collapse of a financial system that puts profits before people, King\'s prophetic writings and speeches underscore his relevance for today. They help us imagine King anew: as a human rights leader whose commitment to unions and an end to poverty was a crucial part of his civil rights agenda. Covering all the civil rights movement highlights-Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Selma, Chicago, and Memphis-award-winning historian Michael K. Honey introduces and traces King\'s dream of economic equality. Gathered in one volume for the first time, the majority of these speeches will be new to most readers. The collection begins with King\'s lectures to unions in the 1960s and includes his addresses during his Poor People\'s Campaign, culminating with his momentous \"Mountaintop\" speech, delivered in support of striking black sanitation workers in Memphis. Unprecedented and timely, \"All Labor Has Dignity\" will more fully restore our understanding of King\'s lasting vision of economic justice, bringing his demand for equality right into the present.

Norton & Company, 2007. The definitive history of the epic struggle for economic justice that became Martin Luther King Jr.\'s last crusade. Memphis in 1968 was ruled by a paternalistic \"plantation mentality\" embodied in its good-old-boy mayor, Henry Loeb. Wretched conditions, abusive white supervisors, poor education, and low wages locked most black workers into poverty. Then two sanitation workers were chewed up like garbage in the back of a faulty truck, igniting a public employee strike that brought to a boil long-simmering issues of racial injustice. With novelistic drama and rich scholarly detail, Michael Honey brings to life the magnetic characters who clashed on the Memphis battlefield: stalwart black workers; fiery black ministers; volatile, young, black-power advocates; idealistic organizers and tough-talking unionists; the first black members of the Memphis city council; the white upper crust who sought to prevent change or conflagration; and, finally, the magisterial Martin Luther King Jr., undertaking a Poor People\'s Campaign at the crossroads of his life, vilified as a subversive, hounded by the FBI, and seeing in the working poor of Memphis his hopes for a better America.

The labor of black workers has been crucial to economic development in the United States. Yet because of racism and segregation, their contribution remains largely unknown. Spanning the 1930s to the present, Black Workers Remember tells the hidden history of African American workers in their own words. It provides striking firsthand accounts of the experiences of black southerners living under segregation in Memphis, Tennessee. Eloquent and personal, these oral histories comprise a unique primary source and provide a new way of understanding the black labor experience during the industrial era. Together, the stories demonstrate how black workers resisted racial apartheid in American industry and underscore the active role of black working people in history. The individual stories are arranged thematically in chapters on labor organizing, Jim Crow in the workplace, police brutality, white union racism, and civil rights struggles. Taken together, the stories ask us to rethink the conventional understanding of the civil rights movement as one led by young people and preachers in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, we see the freedom struggle as the product of generations of people, including workers who organized unions, resisted Jim Crow at work, and built up their families, churches, and communities. The collection also reveals the devastating impact that a globalizing capitalist economy has had on black communities and the importance of organizing the labor movement as an antidote to poverty. Michael Honey gathered these oral histories for more than fifteen years. He weaves them together here into a rich collection reflecting many tragic dimensions of America\'s racial history while drawing new attention to the role of workers and poor people in African American and American history.

By A Customer on October 9, 1998 Format: Paperback Can\'t understand how this country works if you don\'t see how racism has been used, especially to divide workers. Honey writes about a pivotal time in American history when the working class was organizing and had the potential to transform the South for workers and African-Americans.

The Left-Led CIO Unions, most of all FTA Local 19, prepared a cadre of African-American working class leaders in Memphis, who were, in fact, the precursors to those of the 1960s. A must for anyone interested in the study of the Labor role in Civil Rights History in Memphis and the South in the 1930s-1950s. Comment Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Sending feedback...

Honey, Ph.D. George Bush Blues Copyleft Mike Honey 2003 Melody and lyrics by Mike Honey; arrangement and music by Steve DeTray About the Song In about 1940, Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie wrote their famous Talking Union. Unknown to most people, George W. Bush has rewritten the song for his own purposes, and it is reproduced below. It is reproduced here with apologies to folk and labor musicians and to Woody and Pete. This is in the tradition of labor songs and especially parodies which recycle themselves according to current events. For more of those, hear Honey\'s Links on the Chain: Songs of the Labor and Civil Rights Movements. [Listen to MP3] Lyrics Listen to my story, I\'m the man that knows With Bush in charge, nearly anything goes I drop the bombs, I cut the taxes If you ain\'t with me, your\'re part of the axis - of evil that is. When I took office people wondered why I lost the vote but still got pie in the sky The Supremes put me in, without a doubt They put me in, but can you get me out? There\'s floods around the world, transportation\'s a mess The ozone layer, it\'s gone I guess If you don\'t like pollution and all of that shit Let me give you some advice - get used to it! I cut the taxes for the rich, I cut the jobs for the poor They want housing and health care, I wonder what for? I grew up rich, to me everything\'s fine And if you don\'t like it, you can walk the line - terrorist, I guess. I\'ll bring you war and nuclear showers A lot of kids will die, but they won\'t be ours I\'ll put more troops onto foreign soil Its about one word, and the word is oil. Don\'t think for yourself, that\'s just outrageous I don\'t give a damn about your starvation wages We got a war to win against the workers and the poor And if you don\'t like it we\'ll show you the door. We\'ll put you in prison, let you do some time If you\'re black or brown we\'ll make you walk the line We\'ve got prison labor for pennies an hour You can break your back for a dime and a shower. I\'m from Texas y\'all, and we know what to do Get too smart we\'ll electrocute you. If you think you\'ve seen this all before, You have you know, we call it class war - for the rich, that is. Don\'t remember now, your sister and your brother I\'m counting on you to forget about each other! Stand alone, not side by side My rich friends and I we\'ll take you for a ride. Leave us in charge and see what you get If I were you I wouldn\'t place a bet - on the future that is. All you can do is stand up strong I hope you don\'t, because before too long The workers and poor folks might get it together Move into the sunshine from this stormy weather. Unite the people and things might change You could put me and my friends back out on the range Take your country back if you choose But I hope you don\'t - I\'ve got a lot to lose! I mean, take it easy, but take it.   Home | Links | Speaking | Curriculum Vitae Contact: mhoney@u.washington.edu Modified: 01 Oct 2004 - 16:45 PDT Design: UWT Information Technology  About Books Articles & Interviews Music & Film Courses Speaking Curriculum Vitae Pictures Michael K.

Haley Endowed Professorship in the Humanities at the University of Washington, Tacoma (UWT) and previously served as the Harry Bridges Chair of Labor Studies for the University of Washington and as President of the Labor and Working-Class History Association. Honey\'s work is noted for his extensive use of oral history, deep archival research, and vibrant writing style. The History Book Club called Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King\'s Last Campaign (W.W. Norton, 2007), \"a truly great book\" and Cornell West deemed it a \"magisterial treatment.\" It won awards from the Robert F. Kennedy Book Foundation, the Organization of American Historians, the Southern Historical Association, and the United Association of Labor Educators. Honey won the University of Washington, Tacoma\'s Distinguished Research award and the Weyerhaueser Foundation\'s Martin Luther King Award for community leadership and service. Honey\'s collection of King\'s labor and economic justice speeches, titled All Labor Has Dignity (Beacon Press, 2011) is endorsed by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka as \"powerful and inspiring\" and not just a testament to King\'s rhetorical legacy but \"a call to action.\" Honey\'s previous award-winning books proved path breaking in linking labor and civil rights histories. Black Workers Remember: An Oral History of Unionism, Segregation and the Freedom Struggle (University of California Press, 1999 was called \"poignant reading\" by economist Gerald Friedman and \"eloquent\" by historian Bruce Nelson. Many consider his first book, Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights: Organizing Memphis Workers (University of Illinois Press, 1993), a classic and a journal reviewer deemed it \"among the best and most ambitious recent works on labor in the South.\" A southern civil rights and civil liberties organizer from 1970-1976, Honey links scholarship, music, and public speaking with community and labor organizing. He performed his \"Links on the Chain\" labor and civil rights songs with Pete Seeger, Bettie Mae Fikes and other freedom singers and he has given invited lectures before numerous campus and community organizations (the University of Florida, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Louisville, Northwestern and Seattle Universities, the University of Illinois, Northern Illinois University, the National Labor College, and the AFL-CIO among others). As a founding faculty member at the University of Washington, Tacoma (1990), Honey helped shape the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences program and its Ethnic, Gender and Labor studies major. Students in his Tacoma Oral and Community History project have produced scores of personal histories that are archived and online. His \"Underdog Productions\" produced short films including one on war resister Lt. Ehren Watada. Honey has received numerous research grants and fellowships from scholarly organizations. These include the American Council of Learned Societies, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Humanities Center, the Rockefeller Foundation\'s Bellagio Research and Conference Center, the Huntington Library, and the Stanford Humanities Center. He has published many scholarly articles in books and journals as well as columns on current issues in mass media (including the Nation, the Seattle Times and Post-Intelligencer, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, the Tacoma News Tribune, the Progressive, the History News Network).

Refer to the Curriculum Vitae for full details of his scholarly work. Sharecropper\'s Troubadour Descended from African American slaves, Native Americans, and white slaveowners, John Handcox was born to a family of poor Arkansas sharecroppers at one of the hardest times to be black in America. Over the first few decades of the twentieth century, he survived attempted lynchings, floods, droughts, and the ravages of the Great Depression to organize black and white farmers alike on behalf of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. He also became one of the most beloved folk singers of the prewar labor movement, composing songs such as \"Roll the Union On\" and \"There Is Mean Things Happening in this Land\" that bridged racial divides and kept the spirits of striking workers high. Though he withdrew from the public eye for nearly forty years, missing the \"folk boom\" of the 1960s, he resurfaced decades later - just in time to denounce the policies of the Reagan administration in song - and his work was embraced by new generations of labor activists and folk music devotees. This fascinating and beautifully told oral history gives us John Handcox in his own words, recounting a journey that began in a sharecropper\'s shack in the Deep South and went on to shape the labor music tradition, all amid the tangled and troubled history of the United States in the twentieth century. \"A deeply moving account of the life and struggles of John Handcox who became known as \'the sharecropper\'s troubadour\' for the songs he wrote and sang at union meetings in Arkansas, Mississippi, and throughout the nation. Honey\'s book is essential reading to understand the history of labor and black music in the rural south.\"   --William Ferris, author of The Storied South: Voices of Writers and Artists \"An arresting account of the exemplary life of an American genius. Honey\'s and Handcox\'s voices mix in a unique combination of oral history and scholarly research that reminds us of the centrality of music, and of poetry, to US freedom movements.\"   --David Roediger, coauthor of The Production of Difference Videos I Live On Freedom After While Information Facebook Page Click here to order the book Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 1 Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 2 UW Today Article Music (Click a song on the playlist below) \"All Labor Has Dignity\" Beacon Press, 2011. People forget that Dr. King was every bit as committed to economic justice as he was to ending racial segregation. He fought throughout his life to connect the labor and civil rights movements, envisioning them as twin pillars for social reform. As we struggle with massive unemployment, a staggering racial wealth gap, and the near collapse of a financial system that puts profits before people, King\'s prophetic writings and speeches underscore his relevance for today. They help us imagine King anew: as a human rights leader whose commitment to unions and an end to poverty was a crucial part of his civil rights agenda. Covering all the civil rights movement highlights-Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Selma, Chicago, and Memphis-award-winning historian Michael K. Honey introduces and traces King\'s dream of economic equality. Gathered in one volume for the first time, the majority of these speeches will be new to most readers. The collection begins with King\'s lectures to unions in the 1960s and includes his addresses during his Poor People\'s Campaign, culminating with his momentous \"Mountaintop\" speech, delivered in support of striking black sanitation workers in Memphis. Unprecedented and timely, \"All Labor Has Dignity\" will more fully restore our understanding of King\'s lasting vision of economic justice, bringing his demand for equality right into the present.

Norton & Company, 2007. The definitive history of the epic struggle for economic justice that became Martin Luther King Jr.\'s last crusade. Memphis in 1968 was ruled by a paternalistic \"plantation mentality\" embodied in its good-old-boy mayor, Henry Loeb. Wretched conditions, abusive white supervisors, poor education, and low wages locked most black workers into poverty. Then two sanitation workers were chewed up like garbage in the back of a faulty truck, igniting a public employee strike that brought to a boil long-simmering issues of racial injustice. With novelistic drama and rich scholarly detail, Michael Honey brings to life the magnetic characters who clashed on the Memphis battlefield: stalwart black workers; fiery black ministers; volatile, young, black-power advocates; idealistic organizers and tough-talking unionists; the first black members of the Memphis city council; the white upper crust who sought to prevent change or conflagration; and, finally, the magisterial Martin Luther King Jr., undertaking a Poor People\'s Campaign at the crossroads of his life, vilified as a subversive, hounded by the FBI, and seeing in the working poor of Memphis his hopes for a better America.

The labor of black workers has been crucial to economic development in the United States. Yet because of racism and segregation, their contribution remains largely unknown. Spanning the 1930s to the present, Black Workers Remember tells the hidden history of African American workers in their own words. It provides striking firsthand accounts of the experiences of black southerners living under segregation in Memphis, Tennessee. Eloquent and personal, these oral histories comprise a unique primary source and provide a new way of understanding the black labor experience during the industrial era. Together, the stories demonstrate how black workers resisted racial apartheid in American industry and underscore the active role of black working people in history. The individual stories are arranged thematically in chapters on labor organizing, Jim Crow in the workplace, police brutality, white union racism, and civil rights struggles. Taken together, the stories ask us to rethink the conventional understanding of the civil rights movement as one led by young people and preachers in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, we see the freedom struggle as the product of generations of people, including workers who organized unions, resisted Jim Crow at work, and built up their families, churches, and communities. The collection also reveals the devastating impact that a globalizing capitalist economy has had on black communities and the importance of organizing the labor movement as an antidote to poverty. Michael Honey gathered these oral histories for more than fifteen years. He weaves them together here into a rich collection reflecting many tragic dimensions of America\'s racial history while drawing new attention to the role of workers and poor people in African American and American history.

Refer to the Curriculum Vitae for full details of his scholarly work. Sharecropper\'s Troubadour Descended from African American slaves, Native Americans, and white slaveowners, John Handcox was born to a family of poor Arkansas sharecroppers at one of the hardest times to be black in America. Over the first few decades of the twentieth century, he survived attempted lynchings, floods, droughts, and the ravages of the Great Depression to organize black and white farmers alike on behalf of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. He also became one of the most beloved folk singers of the prewar labor movement, composing songs such as \"Roll the Union On\" and \"There Is Mean Things Happening in this Land\" that bridged racial divides and kept the spirits of striking workers high. Though he withdrew from the public eye for nearly forty years, missing the \"folk boom\" of the 1960s, he resurfaced decades later - just in time to denounce the policies of the Reagan administration in song - and his work was embraced by new generations of labor activists and folk music devotees. This fascinating and beautifully told oral history gives us John Handcox in his own words, recounting a journey that began in a sharecropper\'s shack in the Deep South and went on to shape the labor music tradition, all amid the tangled and troubled history of the United States in the twentieth century. \"A deeply moving account of the life and struggles of John Handcox who became known as \'the sharecropper\'s troubadour\' for the songs he wrote and sang at union meetings in Arkansas, Mississippi, and throughout the nation. Honey\'s book is essential reading to understand the history of labor and black music in the rural south.\"   --William Ferris, author of The Storied South: Voices of Writers and Artists \"An arresting account of the exemplary life of an American genius. Honey\'s and Handcox\'s voices mix in a unique combination of oral history and scholarly research that reminds us of the centrality of music, and of poetry, to US freedom movements.\"   --David Roediger, coauthor of The Production of Difference Videos I Live On Freedom After While Information Facebook Page Click here to order the book Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 1 Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 2 UW Today Article Music (Click a song on the playlist below) \"All Labor Has Dignity\" Beacon Press, 2011. People forget that Dr. King was every bit as committed to economic justice as he was to ending racial segregation. He fought throughout his life to connect the labor and civil rights movements, envisioning them as twin pillars for social reform. As we struggle with massive unemployment, a staggering racial wealth gap, and the near collapse of a financial system that puts profits before people, King\'s prophetic writings and speeches underscore his relevance for today. They help us imagine King anew: as a human rights leader whose commitment to unions and an end to poverty was a crucial part of his civil rights agenda. Covering all the civil rights movement highlights-Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Selma, Chicago, and Memphis-award-winning historian Michael K. Honey introduces and traces King\'s dream of economic equality. Gathered in one volume for the first time, the majority of these speeches will be new to most readers. The collection begins with King\'s lectures to unions in the 1960s and includes his addresses during his Poor People\'s Campaign, culminating with his momentous \"Mountaintop\" speech, delivered in support of striking black sanitation workers in Memphis. Unprecedented and timely, \"All Labor Has Dignity\" will more fully restore our understanding of King\'s lasting vision of economic justice, bringing his demand for equality right into the present.

Norton & Company, 2007. The definitive history of the epic struggle for economic justice that became Martin Luther King Jr.\'s last crusade. Memphis in 1968 was ruled by a paternalistic \"plantation mentality\" embodied in its good-old-boy mayor, Henry Loeb. Wretched conditions, abusive white supervisors, poor education, and low wages locked most black workers into poverty. Then two sanitation workers were chewed up like garbage in the back of a faulty truck, igniting a public employee strike that brought to a boil long-simmering issues of racial injustice. With novelistic drama and rich scholarly detail, Michael Honey brings to life the magnetic characters who clashed on the Memphis battlefield: stalwart black workers; fiery black ministers; volatile, young, black-power advocates; idealistic organizers and tough-talking unionists; the first black members of the Memphis city council; the white upper crust who sought to prevent change or conflagration; and, finally, the magisterial Martin Luther King Jr., undertaking a Poor People\'s Campaign at the crossroads of his life, vilified as a subversive, hounded by the FBI, and seeing in the working poor of Memphis his hopes for a better America.

The labor of black workers has been crucial to economic development in the United States. Yet because of racism and segregation, their contribution remains largely unknown. Spanning the 1930s to the present, Black Workers Remember tells the hidden history of African American workers in their own words. It provides striking firsthand accounts of the experiences of black southerners living under segregation in Memphis, Tennessee. Eloquent and personal, these oral histories comprise a unique primary source and provide a new way of understanding the black labor experience during the industrial era. Together, the stories demonstrate how black workers resisted racial apartheid in American industry and underscore the active role of black working people in history. The individual stories are arranged thematically in chapters on labor organizing, Jim Crow in the workplace, police brutality, white union racism, and civil rights struggles. Taken together, the stories ask us to rethink the conventional understanding of the civil rights movement as one led by young people and preachers in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, we see the freedom struggle as the product of generations of people, including workers who organized unions, resisted Jim Crow at work, and built up their families, churches, and communities. The collection also reveals the devastating impact that a globalizing capitalist economy has had on black communities and the importance of organizing the labor movement as an antidote to poverty. Michael Honey gathered these oral histories for more than fifteen years. He weaves them together here into a rich collection reflecting many tragic dimensions of America\'s racial history while drawing new attention to the role of workers and poor people in African American and American history.

The History Book Club called Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King\'s Last Campaign (W.W.

Honey\'s collection of King\'s labor and economic justice speeches, titled All Labor Has Dignity (Beacon Press, 2011) is endorsed by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka as \"powerful and inspiring\" and not just a testament to King\'s rhetorical legacy but \"a call to action.\" Honey\'s previous award-winning books proved path breaking in linking labor and civil rights histories. Black Workers Remember: An Oral History of Unionism, Segregation and the Freedom Struggle (University of California Press, 1999 was called \"poignant reading\" by economist Gerald Friedman and \"eloquent\" by historian Bruce Nelson. Many consider his first book, Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights: Organizing Memphis Workers (University of Illinois Press, 1993), a classic and a journal reviewer deemed it \"among the best and most ambitious recent works on labor in the South.\" A southern civil rights and civil liberties organizer from 1970-1976, Honey links scholarship, music, and public speaking with community and labor organizing.

Gutman Award for an outstanding book in American social history. Widely praised when it was first published and now considered a classic by many, Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights chronicles the southern industrial union movement from the Great Depression to the cold war, a history that created the context for the sanitation workers\' strike that brought Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to Memphis in April 1968. Michael K. Honey documents the dramatic labor battles and sometimes heroic activities of organizers and ordinary workers that helped to set the stage for segregation\'s demise. \"Packs the emotive power of a zillion \'race\' memoirs precisely because it is the story of what happened when black and white workers collectively challenged the powers-that-be in the meanest city in the South.\"--Robin D.

Haley Endowed Professorship in the Humanities at the University of Washington, Tacoma (UWT) and previously served as the Harry Bridges Chair of Labor Studies for the University of Washington and as President of the Labor and Working-Class History Association. Honey\'s work is noted for his extensive use of oral history, deep archival research, and vibrant writing style. The History Book Club called Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King\'s Last Campaign (W.W. Norton, 2007), \"a truly great book\" and Cornell West deemed it a \"magisterial treatment.\" It won awards from the Robert F. Kennedy Book Foundation, the Organization of American Historians, the Southern Historical Association, and the United Association of Labor Educators. Honey won the University of Washington, Tacoma\'s Distinguished Research award and the Weyerhaueser Foundation\'s Martin Luther King Award for community leadership and service. Honey\'s collection of King\'s labor and economic justice speeches, titled All Labor Has Dignity (Beacon Press, 2011) is endorsed by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka as \"powerful and inspiring\" and not just a testament to King\'s rhetorical legacy but \"a call to action.\" Honey\'s previous award-winning books proved path breaking in linking labor and civil rights histories. Black Workers Remember: An Oral History of Unionism, Segregation and the Freedom Struggle (University of California Press, 1999 was called \"poignant reading\" by economist Gerald Friedman and \"eloquent\" by historian Bruce Nelson. Many consider his first book, Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights: Organizing Memphis Workers (University of Illinois Press, 1993), a classic and a journal reviewer deemed it \"among the best and most ambitious recent works on labor in the South.\" A southern civil rights and civil liberties organizer from 1970-1976, Honey links scholarship, music, and public speaking with community and labor organizing.

Refer to the Curriculum Vitae for full details of his scholarly work. Sharecropper\'s Troubadour Descended from African American slaves, Native Americans, and white slaveowners, John Handcox was born to a family of poor Arkansas sharecroppers at one of the hardest times to be black in America. Over the first few decades of the twentieth century, he survived attempted lynchings, floods, droughts, and the ravages of the Great Depression to organize black and white farmers alike on behalf of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. He also became one of the most beloved folk singers of the prewar labor movement, composing songs such as \"Roll the Union On\" and \"There Is Mean Things Happening in this Land\" that bridged racial divides and kept the spirits of striking workers high. Though he withdrew from the public eye for nearly forty years, missing the \"folk boom\" of the 1960s, he resurfaced decades later - just in time to denounce the policies of the Reagan administration in song - and his work was embraced by new generations of labor activists and folk music devotees. This fascinating and beautifully told oral history gives us John Handcox in his own words, recounting a journey that began in a sharecropper\'s shack in the Deep South and went on to shape the labor music tradition, all amid the tangled and troubled history of the United States in the twentieth century. \"A deeply moving account of the life and struggles of John Handcox who became known as \'the sharecropper\'s troubadour\' for the songs he wrote and sang at union meetings in Arkansas, Mississippi, and throughout the nation. Honey\'s book is essential reading to understand the history of labor and black music in the rural south.\"   --William Ferris, author of The Storied South: Voices of Writers and Artists \"An arresting account of the exemplary life of an American genius. Honey\'s and Handcox\'s voices mix in a unique combination of oral history and scholarly research that reminds us of the centrality of music, and of poetry, to US freedom movements.\"   --David Roediger, coauthor of The Production of Difference Videos I Live On Freedom After While Information Facebook Page Click here to order the book Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 1 Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 2 UW Today Article Music (Click a song on the playlist below) \"All Labor Has Dignity\" Beacon Press, 2011. People forget that Dr. King was every bit as committed to economic justice as he was to ending racial segregation. He fought throughout his life to connect the labor and civil rights movements, envisioning them as twin pillars for social reform. As we struggle with massive unemployment, a staggering racial wealth gap, and the near collapse of a financial system that puts profits before people, King\'s prophetic writings and speeches underscore his relevance for today. They help us imagine King anew: as a human rights leader whose commitment to unions and an end to poverty was a crucial part of his civil rights agenda. Covering all the civil rights movement highlights-Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Selma, Chicago, and Memphis-award-winning historian Michael K. Honey introduces and traces King\'s dream of economic equality. Gathered in one volume for the first time, the majority of these speeches will be new to most readers. The collection begins with King\'s lectures to unions in the 1960s and includes his addresses during his Poor People\'s Campaign, culminating with his momentous \"Mountaintop\" speech, delivered in support of striking black sanitation workers in Memphis. Unprecedented and timely, \"All Labor Has Dignity\" will more fully restore our understanding of King\'s lasting vision of economic justice, bringing his demand for equality right into the present.

Norton & Company, 2007. The definitive history of the epic struggle for economic justice that became Martin Luther King Jr.\'s last crusade. Memphis in 1968 was ruled by a paternalistic \"plantation mentality\" embodied in its good-old-boy mayor, Henry Loeb. Wretched conditions, abusive white supervisors, poor education, and low wages locked most black workers into poverty. Then two sanitation workers were chewed up like garbage in the back of a faulty truck, igniting a public employee strike that brought to a boil long-simmering issues of racial injustice. With novelistic drama and rich scholarly detail, Michael Honey brings to life the magnetic characters who clashed on the Memphis battlefield: stalwart black workers; fiery black ministers; volatile, young, black-power advocates; idealistic organizers and tough-talking unionists; the first black members of the Memphis city council; the white upper crust who sought to prevent change or conflagration; and, finally, the magisterial Martin Luther King Jr., undertaking a Poor People\'s Campaign at the crossroads of his life, vilified as a subversive, hounded by the FBI, and seeing in the working poor of Memphis his hopes for a better America.

The labor of black workers has been crucial to economic development in the United States. Yet because of racism and segregation, their contribution remains largely unknown. Spanning the 1930s to the present, Black Workers Remember tells the hidden history of African American workers in their own words. It provides striking firsthand accounts of the experiences of black southerners living under segregation in Memphis, Tennessee. Eloquent and personal, these oral histories comprise a unique primary source and provide a new way of understanding the black labor experience during the industrial era. Together, the stories demonstrate how black workers resisted racial apartheid in American industry and underscore the active role of black working people in history. The individual stories are arranged thematically in chapters on labor organizing, Jim Crow in the workplace, police brutality, white union racism, and civil rights struggles. Taken together, the stories ask us to rethink the conventional understanding of the civil rights movement as one led by young people and preachers in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, we see the freedom struggle as the product of generations of people, including workers who organized unions, resisted Jim Crow at work, and built up their families, churches, and communities. The collection also reveals the devastating impact that a globalizing capitalist economy has had on black communities and the importance of organizing the labor movement as an antidote to poverty. Michael Honey gathered these oral histories for more than fifteen years. He weaves them together here into a rich collection reflecting many tragic dimensions of America\'s racial history while drawing new attention to the role of workers and poor people in African American and American history.

He teaches African-American, civil rights and labor history and specializes in work on Martin Luther King, Jr. Honey holds the Fred T. and Dorothy G. Haley Endowed Professorship in the Humanities at the University of Washington, Tacoma (UWT) and previously served as the Harry Bridges Chair of Labor Studies for the University of Washington and as President of the Labor and Working-Class History Association. Honey\'s work is noted for his extensive use of oral history, deep archival research, and vibrant writing style. The History Book Club called Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King\'s Last Campaign (W.W. Norton, 2007), \"a truly great book\" and Cornell West deemed it a \"magisterial treatment.\" It won awards from the Robert F. Kennedy Book Foundation, the Organization of American Historians, the Southern Historical Association, and the United Association of Labor Educators. Honey won the University of Washington, Tacoma\'s Distinguished Research award and the Weyerhaueser Foundation\'s Martin Luther King Award for community leadership and service. Honey\'s collection of King\'s labor and economic justice speeches, titled All Labor Has Dignity (Beacon Press, 2011) is endorsed by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka as \"powerful and inspiring\" and not just a testament to King\'s rhetorical legacy but \"a call to action.\" Honey\'s previous award-winning books proved path breaking in linking labor and civil rights histories. Black Workers Remember: An Oral History of Unionism, Segregation and the Freedom Struggle (University of California Press, 1999 was called \"poignant reading\" by economist Gerald Friedman and \"eloquent\" by historian Bruce Nelson. Many consider his first book, Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights: Organizing Memphis Workers (University of Illinois Press, 1993), a classic and a journal reviewer deemed it \"among the best and most ambitious recent works on labor in the South.\" A southern civil rights and civil liberties organizer from 1970-1976, Honey links scholarship, music, and public speaking with community and labor organizing. He performed his \"Links on the Chain\" labor and civil rights songs with Pete Seeger, Bettie Mae Fikes and other freedom singers and he has given invited lectures before numerous campus and community organizations (the University of Florida, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Louisville, Northwestern and Seattle Universities, the University of Illinois, Northern Illinois University, the National Labor College, and the AFL-CIO among others). As a founding faculty member at the University of Washington, Tacoma (1990), Honey helped shape the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences program and its Ethnic, Gender and Labor studies major. Students in his Tacoma Oral and Community History project have produced scores of personal histories that are archived and online. His \"Underdog Productions\" produced short films including one on war resister Lt. Ehren Watada. Honey has received numerous research grants and fellowships from scholarly organizations. These include the American Council of Learned Societies, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Humanities Center, the Rockefeller Foundation\'s Bellagio Research and Conference Center, the Huntington Library, and the Stanford Humanities Center. He has published many scholarly articles in books and journals as well as columns on current issues in mass media (including the Nation, the Seattle Times and Post-Intelligencer, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, the Tacoma News Tribune, the Progressive, the History News Network). Honey is a graduate of Northern Illinois University (Ph.D.), Howard University (M.A.) and Oakland University (B.A.). He lives in Tacoma with his wife Pat Krueger, a professor of music education at the University of Puget Sound.

Refer to the Curriculum Vitae for full details of his scholarly work. Sharecropper\'s Troubadour Descended from African American slaves, Native Americans, and white slaveowners, John Handcox was born to a family of poor Arkansas sharecroppers at one of the hardest times to be black in America. Over the first few decades of the twentieth century, he survived attempted lynchings, floods, droughts, and the ravages of the Great Depression to organize black and white farmers alike on behalf of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. He also became one of the most beloved folk singers of the prewar labor movement, composing songs such as \"Roll the Union On\" and \"There Is Mean Things Happening in this Land\" that bridged racial divides and kept the spirits of striking workers high. Though he withdrew from the public eye for nearly forty years, missing the \"folk boom\" of the 1960s, he resurfaced decades later - just in time to denounce the policies of the Reagan administration in song - and his work was embraced by new generations of labor activists and folk music devotees. This fascinating and beautifully told oral history gives us John Handcox in his own words, recounting a journey that began in a sharecropper\'s shack in the Deep South and went on to shape the labor music tradition, all amid the tangled and troubled history of the United States in the twentieth century. \"A deeply moving account of the life and struggles of John Handcox who became known as \'the sharecropper\'s troubadour\' for the songs he wrote and sang at union meetings in Arkansas, Mississippi, and throughout the nation. Honey\'s book is essential reading to understand the history of labor and black music in the rural south.\"   --William Ferris, author of The Storied South: Voices of Writers and Artists \"An arresting account of the exemplary life of an American genius. Honey\'s and Handcox\'s voices mix in a unique combination of oral history and scholarly research that reminds us of the centrality of music, and of poetry, to US freedom movements.\"   --David Roediger, coauthor of The Production of Difference Videos I Live On Freedom After While Information Facebook Page Click here to order the book Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 1 Sharecroppers Troubadour Flyer 2 UW Today Article Music (Click a song on the playlist below) \"All Labor Has Dignity\" Beacon Press, 2011. People forget that Dr. King was every bit as committed to economic justice as he was to ending racial segregation. He fought throughout his life to connect the labor and civil rights movements, envisioning them as twin pillars for social reform. As we struggle with massive unemployment, a staggering racial wealth gap, and the near collapse of a financial system that puts profits before people, King\'s prophetic writings and speeches underscore his relevance for today. They help us imagine King anew: as a human rights leader whose commitment to unions and an end to poverty was a crucial part of his civil rights agenda. Covering all the civil rights movement highlights-Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Selma, Chicago, and Memphis-award-winning historian Michael K. Honey introduces and traces King\'s dream of economic equality. Gathered in one volume for the first time, the majority of these speeches will be new to most readers. The collection begins with King\'s lectures to unions in the 1960s and includes his addresses during his Poor People\'s Campaign, culminating with his momentous \"Mountaintop\" speech, delivered in support of striking black sanitation workers in Memphis. Unprecedented and timely, \"All Labor Has Dignity\" will more fully restore our understanding of King\'s lasting vision of economic justice, bringing his demand for equality right into the present.

Norton & Company, 2007. The definitive history of the epic struggle for economic justice that became Martin Luther King Jr.\'s last crusade. Memphis in 1968 was ruled by a paternalistic \"plantation mentality\" embodied in its good-old-boy mayor, Henry Loeb. Wretched conditions, abusive white supervisors, poor education, and low wages locked most black workers into poverty. Then two sanitation workers were chewed up like garbage in the back of a faulty truck, igniting a public employee strike that brought to a boil long-simmering issues of racial injustice. With novelistic drama and rich scholarly detail, Michael Honey brings to life the magnetic characters who clashed on the Memphis battlefield: stalwart black workers; fiery black ministers; volatile, young, black-power advocates; idealistic organizers and tough-talking unionists; the first black members of the Memphis city council; the white upper crust who sought to prevent change or conflagration; and, finally, the magisterial Martin Luther King Jr., undertaking a Poor People\'s Campaign at the crossroads of his life, vilified as a subversive, hounded by the FBI, and seeing in the working poor of Memphis his hopes for a better America.

The labor of black workers has been crucial to economic development in the United States. Yet because of racism and segregation, their contribution remains largely unknown. Spanning the 1930s to the present, Black Workers Remember tells the hidden history of African American workers in their own words. It provides striking firsthand accounts of the experiences of black southerners living under segregation in Memphis, Tennessee. Eloquent and personal, these oral histories comprise a unique primary source and provide a new way of understanding the black labor experience during the industrial era. Together, the stories demonstrate how black workers resisted racial apartheid in American industry and underscore the active role of black working people in history. The individual stories are arranged thematically in chapters on labor organizing, Jim Crow in the workplace, police brutality, white union racism, and civil rights struggles. Taken together, the stories ask us to rethink the conventional understanding of the civil rights movement as one led by young people and preachers in the 1950s and 1960s. Instead, we see the freedom struggle as the product of generations of people, including workers who organized unions, resisted Jim Crow at work, and built up their families, churches, and communities. The collection also reveals the devastating impact that a globalizing capitalist economy has had on black communities and the importance of organizing the labor movement as an antidote to poverty. Michael Honey gathered these oral histories for more than fifteen years. He weaves them together here into a rich collection reflecting many tragic dimensions of America\'s racial history while drawing new attention to the role of workers and poor people in African American and American history.

Ked v roku 1996 zomrel matematik Paul Erdos, vsetky svetove noviny, vcetne The Times a Wall Street Journal, uverejnili nekrolog.  To sa v pripade vedca stalo hadam prvykrat v dejinach. 20 septembra bude tomu prave 11 rokov. Spomienkove clanky sa pisu pri okruhlych vyrociach.  Avsak Erdosovou najvacsou laskou boli prvocisla. Preto sa mi zdalo vhodne pockat na 11 vyrocie. Hoci Erdos urcite patril do desiatky najlepsich matematikov 20 storocia, noviny nepisali o nom  kvoli jeho matematickym vysledkom, ale kvoli jeho sposobu zivota. Ak by existovala sien slavy pre excentrikov, Erdos by bol do nej zvoleny ako prvy. Pritom nic nepredstieral, nestaral sa o svoj image. (Einstein sa stazoval, ze kvoli jeho slave sa vela ludi s nim chce porozpravat a tym ho pripravuju o cas. Jeho priatel mu navrhol jednoduche riesenie: Daj sa ostrihat.) Stastie mi doprialo stretnut sa a spolupracovat s Erdsom.  Preto v tomto clanku sa chcem podelit aj o moje spomienky na neho.     Paul Erdos sa narodil 26 marca 1913 v Budapesti v zidovskej rodine dvoch stredoskolskych ucitelov matematiky. Ten den jeho dve sestry, 3 a 5 rocna, dostali sarlach a zomreli v priebehu 24 hodin. Hoci bol zazracne dieta, rodicia ho povazovali za najmenej nadaneho z troch  surodencov. Uz v troch rokoch ohuroval schopnostou vynasobit v hlave trojmiestne cisla; to vsak skor patri do cirkusu ako do matematiky. Casto s hrdostou spominal, ze vo veku 4 rokov sam \"objavil\" zaporne cisla a ako s nimi treba pocitat. To zasa ludstvu trvalo tisicrocia.  Pred univerzitou do skoly nikdy pravidelne nechodil, rodicia sa bali aby neochorel. Napriek tomu vo veku 20 rokov uz mal PhD. V tridsiatke  patril medzi najlepsich matematikov na svete a zostal nim az do konca zivota napriek vysokemu veku. Avsak Erdos bol vazeny a doslova uctievany v matematickej komunite hlavne kvoli niecomu inemu. Aby som  mohol vysvetlit dovody, pokusim sa najskor poopravit mylnu predstavu vacsiny verejnosti, aj tej s univerzitnym vzdelanim, o tom co su hodnoty a modus operandi matematickeho sveta. Prva cast clanku: Erdos Matematik Temer kazdy ma k matematike vyhraneny vztah, vacsina ludi  negativny, zvysni ju maju radi. V tom je matematika podobna bryndzovym haluskam. Neviem o cudzincovi, ktory by bol k nim neutralny. Napriek tomu temer vsetci povazuju matematiku za mrtvu vedu, kde uz vsetky vzorce a poucky su zname. Dobry matematik je ten kto vie rychlo vyriesit vsetky problemy zo zbierky uloh. Pravda je uplne inde. V dnesnej dobe sa matematika rozvija tak intenzivne ako nikdy predtym. Rocne sa v matematickych casopisoch uverejni vyse sto tisic novych theorem (=\"vzorcov a pouciek\"). Kazdy novy vysledok sice zodpovie nejaku otazku, zaroven vsak nastoli  dva, tri nove.  Mnozstvo toho co nevieme sa stale zvacsuje. Na dobrej univerzite sa vyzaduje, aby ucitel pravidelne publikoval odborne clanky v poprednych vedeckych casopisoch. \"Publish or perish\", \"Publikuj alebo zahyn\".  A publikovat sa daju iba nove originalne theormy, popripade novy dokaz znameho vysledku. Ti najlepsi v matematike bud vyriesenia znamu  hypotezu, ktora odolavala usiliu matematikov po dlhu dobu alebo vyvinu novu teoriu ktora ovplyni vyvoj matematiky. Fermatova hypoteza bola vyriesena Wilesom iba po 350 rokoch. Tym si Wiles zabezpecil v matematike nesmrtelnost. Hypoteza o existencii nekonecneho poctu prvociselnych dvojciat caka na vyriesenie uz vyse 2000 rokov. V matematike sa velmi ceni aj schopnost sformulovat dobru otazku a  vyslovit hypotezu, co je spravna odpoved. Autor hypotezy ju nevie vyriesit ale zaujimava hypoteza sa stane stredobodom usilia mnohych matematikov. Vyssie povedane sa da ilustrovat na paradajkach. Zrejme kazdy aspon raz okusil caprese, nakrajanu paradajku prekladanu s mozzarelou. Vacsina ludi ju zje bez filozofickych uvah. Vytvarni  umelci sa zamyslia, ci caprese inspirovalo rakusku vlajku. Matematik, schopny pozriet sa na bezne veci novym pohladom,  polozi otazku: V ktorej dedine vyrobcovia mozarelly vymysleli paradajky? Vyslovi hypotezu, ze meno dediny je Ristorante. Neskor sa ukaze, ze spravna odpoved bola Pomidore. Napriek tomu si vsetci budu pamatat, ze vytycil spravny smer vyskumu. Pocet publikovanych prac je iba pomocnym kriteriom pri hodnoteni matematika, ale obycajne kvantita hovori nieco aj o kvalite. 99% matematikov, vratane tych najlepsich, uverejni za zivot do 100 vedeckych clankov. Erdos ich publikoval vyse 1500, so 450 spoluatormi. V ramci toho vznikla medzi matematikmi hra, ktoru niektori beru vazne. Kazdy, kto publikoval spolocny clanok s Erdosom ma Erdosovo cislo jedna. Ti, co maju clanok s niekym kto ma Erdosovo cislo jedna, maju Erdosovo cislo dva. Ak publikujete clanok s niekym kto ma Erdosovo cislo dva dostanete Erdosovo cislo tri, atd. Samozrejme, ciel je mat co najmensie Erdosovo cislo. Este ohromujucejsia bola sirka Erdosoveho zaberu. Matematika sa dnes deli na 40 zakladnych odborov, z ktorych ma kazdy mnoho pododborov. Napriklad, teoria cisiel, linearna algebra, kodovanie, atd. Vacsina ludi publikuje prace v dvoch, troch pododboroch jednej discipliny. Erdos publikoval clanky v 17-tich z danych 40 odborov. Ked to zistite, je lahke zostat skromny a neprecenit svoje schpnosti. Raz pri navsteve na univerzite v Texase Erdos sedel v katedrovom laungi. Na tabuli bola napisana theorema z funkcionaalnej analyzy. Bol to vysledok dvoch miestnych matematikov, ktori nam boli velmi hrdi.  Ich dokaz zabral 30 stran. Erdos nemal o danom odbore matematiky ziadne vedomosti. Zo zvedavosti si nechal vysvetlit, co symboly znamenaju. Zamyslel sa a o 15 minut napisal na tabulu dokaz, ktory mal dva riadky. Po niecom takom musite zacat verit na zazraky. Je dane charakterom  matematiky, a obzvlast diskretnej matematiky, ktora bola jednym zo stredobodov Erdosovho zaujmu, ( a v ktorej pracujem aj ja), ze vedeckym prinosom moze byt aj kratkodoba intenzivna spolupraca na otvorenych problemoch. Preto sa matematici casto navstevuju a stretavaju na konferenciach. Tisice matematikov stravi 2-4 mesiace do roka cestovanim po celom svete; to je dane nadnarodnostou matematiky. Viac im ich univerzita (manzelka) nedovoli, aby sa prilis nenarusilo vyucovanie.  Pocas predoslych 12 mesaicov, ktore neboli moj sabbatical, som takto pobudol na vsetkych kontinentoch okrem Afriky. V mojom odbore je to uplne bezne. (Sabbatical, rok  plateneho volna, ktory univerzita udeli kazdy siedmy rok, aby ucitel mohol drzat krok s vyvojom jeho discipliny). Nik sa vsak ani v tomto ohlade nemohol porovnat s Erdosom. Niektory rok Erdos travil cestovanim po konferenciach a navstevami univerzit 11 mesiacov v roku.  On si to mohol dovolit, lebo nemal ziadne stale zamestnanie.  Ale tymto ani staly prijem!  Medzi jednotlivymi pobytmi sa nevracal domov (do Budapesti), ako to robia vsetci ostatni, on isiel priamo z jednej univerzity na dalsiu, z jednej konferencie na dalsie sympozium. Presunul sa dalej, ked uz po intelektualnej aj fyzickej stranke totalne vycerpal domacich. Trvalo mu to 3-14 dni. Erdos takto navstivil 25 krajin. Mal 163 cm, 50 kil, a navonok vyzeral vetcho a chorlavo. Nedalo sa tusit odkial na to berie energiu. Vacsinu ludi by zabilo uz samotne cestovanie, ktore on absolvoval bez najmensich tazkosti. Vzdy bolo niekolko univerzit kde ho vdacne privitali ohlaseneho na poslednu chvilu. Najlepsi sposob presvedcit ho aby prisiel k Vam bolo zatelefonovat mu a povedat ake ciastocne vysledky mate pri rieseni doleziteho problemu. Vyska ponukaneho honoraru nehrala nikdy ziadnu rolu. Ludom nevadilo, ze mat Erdosa ako hosta znamenalo sa kompletne sa o neho postarat; priviezt a odviezt ho na letisko,  starat sa o jeho jedlo, prat pradlo, balit mu kufor, ustlat mu postel. A postarat sa o financie na zaplatenie letenky, honoraru a hotelu alebo, co on uprednostnoval, si ho zobrat k sebe domov. Preco to tolko ludi bolo ochotnych robit, cim sa Erdos odplatil? Erdos bol protipol vedeckej primadony. Pocas svojho pobytu bol ochotny spolupracovat s kazdym, ci uz uznavanym odbornikom alebo zacinajucim studentom. Bol k dispozicii tak dlho pokial dany clovek nevycerpal momentalne svoje napady alebo stacil sledovat jeho myslienky.  Hovoril o novych hypotezach, podelil sa so vsetkym, co o ich rieseni vedel. Jemu bolo jedno ci dany problem vyriesi on alebo ho niekto pred cielovou paskou predbehne a zoberie celu slavu. On chcel, aby sme sa dozvedeli pravdu. Vela ludi dostalo zamestnanie, definitivu, povysenie prave vdaka tomu, ze vyriesili  Erdosov problem, alebo mali Erdosovo cislo jedna. Z nasej strany v tom bol kus pragmatickeho \"Publish or perish\". Ale Erdos dokazal preniest na ludi aj svoju vasen k matematike. Nebol taborovy recnik, ktory strhne dav svojim prejavom. Hovoril tichym hlasom, ktory nikdy nezvysoval, so silnym prizvukom. Napriek tomu intelektualne elektrizoval okolie.  Pocas jeho navstevy to vrelo, kazdy venoval matematike viac hodin ako zvycajne.  Dal samozrejme prednasku. Hlavne vsak bol doslova 24 hodin denne pripraveny spolupracovat s miestnymi ludmi. Nebol najmensi problem ho zobudit o 3-tej rano, a podelit sa s nim o najnovsi napad ako atakovat problem na ktorom ste prave spolupracovali.  Ihned zacal o tom premyslet a komentovat to.  Na druhej strane hostitel musel byt pripraveny, ze Erdos o 2-hej rano bez zaklopania vojde do jeho manzelskej spalne a zacne mu zdelovat svoj napad. On sa tvaril, ze v spalni nic ine ako matematika sa neda robit. Erdos pracoval na mnohych problemoch paralelne. Preto potreboval vela spolupracovnikov a neustale hladal dalsich, nadanych ludi. To bol dovod preco cestoval. Jeho tempu sa nedalo dlho stacit.  \"Znicil\" jednych, a isiel dalej.  Ak si pri praci protreboval overit matematicky udaj, ihned isiel telefonovat kompetentnemu clovekovi. Mal vynikajucu pamat, vedel stovky telefonnych cislel. Na namietku, ze na vychodnom pobrezi maju iba dve hodiny rano Erdos povedal: To je fajn, urcite bude doma. Vravieval, Ludvik XIV povedal: \"Ja som stat\", Trocky mohol povedat: \"Ja som spolocnost\", a ja hovorim:\"Ja som realita\". Ako bolo vyssie spomenute, v matematike je velmi dolezite spravne polozit otazka, vytycit smer vyskumu.  Erdos bol v tom hadam najlepsi v dejinach. Nie je tazke sformulovat otazku, ktora je beznadejne tazka pre dnesnu uroven matematiky. Erdos mal schopnost formulovat hypotezy, ktore posuvali nase poznanie prave o tolko, co bolo v momentalnych silach. Erdos pripisoval k niektorym svojim hypotezam penazne odmeny za ich vyriesenie. Tym vlastne hovoril, ake su podla jeho nazoru tazke. Najvyssia odmena, zatial nevyzdvihnuta, je $3000. Upozornujem, ze pokus zivit sa riesenim Erdosovych problemov je ista cesta k smrti hladom. V roku 1971 zomrela vo veku 91 Erdosova matka. Poslednych 7 rokov zivota ho sprevadzala na vsetkych cestach. Nemala cestovanie rada, po anglicky vedela iba par slov, ale chcela byt pri synovi. Erdos jej to oplacal laskou aku je iba malokedy vidiet u syna voci matke. Nikdy sa z jej smrti uplne nespamatal. Riesil to tym ze sa stal matematickym mnichom. Okrem matematiky ho uz zaujimalo malo veci; najviac svetova politika a rad pocuval vaznu hudbu. Hoci sa to zdalo nemozne, este vystupnoval pracovne tempo. Denne aktivne venoval matematike 19-20 hodin. To vsak aj on uz zvladal iba za pomoci amphetaminov. Takto zil doslova do posledneho dna svojho zivota.             Erdos mal svoj slovnik, ktory bol medzi matematikmi velmi dobre znamy. Spomeniem iba dve najslavnejsie frazy. Prva bola \"My brain is open\". Pouzival ju v momente, nez zacal s niekym pracovat na matematicke. Rad spominal historku, ked koncom 19-ho storocia dvaja ludia si sucasne vsimli, ze radioaktivny material zanecha stopy na fotografickej dosticke. Prvy vystrihal vedecku komunitu aby si takto neznehodonotili drahy fotograficky material (his brain was not open), a jeho meno si uz nikto nepamata. Druhy sa volal Rontgen. Erdos, ktory v mladosti taktiez prehliadol velky objav, tym chcel povedat, ze sa mu to uz nestane. Druhou frazou bola \"This is straight from The Book\".  Erdos \"veril\" v existenciu Knihy, v ktorej su napisane vsetky jednoduche a elegantne dokazy matematickych teorem. Hovorieval, ze obcas nam Pan Boh (Erdos bol ateista) dovoli na chvilocku do nej nazriet. Tato fraza bola najvyssia pochvala aku sa dalo od Erdosa dostat. Pocas mojho pobytu na Simon Fraser University sme s Kathy Heinrich, ako vedlajsi produkt ineho badania, nasli novy dokaz malej Fermatovej vety. Tento dokaz bol \"elementarny\" v Erdosovom zmysle. Nezatelefonoval som Erdosovi o dokaze, lebo som chcel byt osobne pritom ked povie okridlenu frazu o Knihe. Pri najblizsom stretnuti ma pozorne vypocul a namiesto ocakavaneho povedal: Mne sa dokaz cez kongruencie paci viacej. To bol koniec mojej kratkej cesty ku slave. Dokaz bol sice publikovany v najcitanejsom matematickom casopise, American Math. Monthly, ale bola to mala naplast. Erdos ako clovek a moje spomienky na neho Uz z predoslej casti, v ktorej som pisal o Erdosovi matematikovi, bolo zrejme ze sa lisil od ostatnych. Nebolo to len tym, ze matematika bola pre neho ovela dolezitejsia ako vsetko ine. Prehnana starostlivost rodicov, ktoi sa bali aby neochorel,  mala za nasledok, ze Erdos si prvykrat sam uviazal topanky ked mal 11 rokov a namazal chleba vo veku 21. Tvrdil, ze ak by chcel, urcite by vedel uvarit caj a vajce na tvrdo. Nikdy to vsak neskusil. Hoci bol vynikajuci riesitel matematickych problemov, mal tazkosti pri rieseni beznych zivotnych situacii. Ralph Faudree spomina, ze pri jednej z Erdosovych navstev u nich sa spustila prudka burka. Erdos vosiel o 3-tej v noci do ich spalne a oznamil im, ze v jeho izbe sa voda leje dovnutra cez otvorene okno, a ze by s tym mali nieco robit.  Nikdy nepochopil, lebo sa mu nechcelo, ako sa spusti pracka. On nebol typ cloveka ktory nevie kolko stoji kilo chleba - on ani nevedel, kde sa chlieb kupuje. Zivot ho k tomu nedonutil. Presnejsie povedane, on nepripustil, aby ho ho zivot k tomu donutil. Skratka rydzy genius. Elegantny sposob ako to urobit, popisany vyssie, nie je pre beznych smrtelnikov. Ti si nanajvys dokazu urobit sluzku z manzelky. To bol zasa navod nepouzitelny pre Erdosa. Erdos  nemal sexualnu potrebu, a nikdy ani nemal ziaden vztah so zenou (aby nevzniklo nedorozumenie v dnesnej dobe je patricne dolozit, ze ani s muzom). Bolo mi luto, o co pri absencii sexualnej tuzby prichadza. Ak si vsak clovek uvedomi, coho vsetkeho bol vdaka tomu usetreny, potom nie je celkom jasne, kto ma koho lutovat. V matematickej komunite sa velmi ceni zmysel pre humor, samozrejme intelektualny. Odbornemu pozorovaniu typu, citat z L+S:  \"V Indii dodnes zomiera 40% ludi na sanskrit\", sa dostane hlbokeho uznania. Mimochodom, som si isty, ze L+S nemohli mat v skole najmensi problem s matematikou. Erdos mal skvely zmysel pre humor, ale nebol komediant, ako povedzme John Conway z Princeton University, jeden z najlepsich zijucich matematikov. Na velkej medzinarodnej konferencii nam  Conway pocas svojej prednasky zdelil, ze v momente, ked dostal rozhodujuci napad na riesenie velmi doleziteho problemu v teorii kodovania, si lahol na chrbat na zem, dvihol ruky a nohy a radostne sa hihnal ako velmi spokojny kojenec.  Kedze si nebol isty, ci publikum si to vie dostatocne zivo predstavit, za vseobecneho nadsenia 400 pritomnych matematikov nam to nazorne predviedol. A to na zemi bolo iba linoleum.  Nieco take by sa nemohlo stat na kongrese lekarov. Preco potom si ludia myslia o matematikoch, a nie o lekaroch, ze su suchari?  Pravdu povediac, ani Erdos by take nieco neurobil. Dana forma aplikacie myslienok z Orbis Pictus mu bola cudzia.  Erdosov zmysel pre humor bol iny. Napriklad, raz  pocas svojej prednasky chcel citovat vysledok ineho matematika a povedal: Nemozem si momentalne spomenut na jeho meno ale urcite sa nevola Alzheimer. Netreba zdoraznovat, ze po tomto prehlaseni to v sale vrelo. Avsak aj jeho jemny zmysel pre humor niekedy zlyhal.  Pri jednej veceri sa ma pytal na Jima B., nasho spolocneho znameho zo Simon Fraser University. Tak som spomenul, ako Jima prisla navsitivit  na Vianoce svokra a doniesla mu pod stromcek dve kosele. Jim chcel mat doma pokoj. Preto si  nasledujuci den dal jednu z nich na seba. Svokra reagovala: A ta druha sa Ti nepaci? Vsetci pri stole sa smiali ale Erdos iba zavrcal: Ved si nemohol dat oba kosele odrazu ! Ak niekto nemal svokru,  bez ohladu na vysku jeho IQ mu iste veci ostanu natrvalo  utajene. Erdosa som prvykrat stretol v roku 1980,  tesne po obhajeni vedeckej aspirantury. Erdos sa cestou do Budapesti zastavil na par hodin v Bratislave. Akademik Schwarz a moj skolitel profesor Znam ma prizvali aby som isiel s nimi na veceru. Erdos sa mi predstavil akoby bol uplne neznamy clovek, a nie hviezda najvacsej velkosti. Ja som si s nim potriasol rukou. To  bol moj jediny prispevok ku zaujimavemu rozhovoru pri stole.  Pocas celej vecere som strnulo sedel a dbal iba o to, aby mi od napatia nezabehlo pri jedle. Zhodou okolnosti, za kratky cas, Erdos prisiel do Bratislavy znova. Tentokrat som mal moznost s nim pobudnut sam par hodin. Znova sa mi predstavil. Po vzoru nasej narodnej tradicie som sa citil ukrivdeny a dal som to aj na javo.  Ved sme sa zoznamili pred 6 tyzdnami a ja som pri tom stretnuti nevyrobil ziadne faux pas. To si predsa  musel vsimnut. On sa mi ospravedlnoval, ze stretava tolko ludi, ze si vsetkych nemoze pamatat. Bolo zrejme, ze ak ho chcem naucit moje meno, bude treba zabudnut na tradicie, a miesto stazovania sa na osud zacat usilovne robit.  Cely zvysok rozhovoru uz patril matematike. Erdos sa ma pytal na akych matematickych otazkach  pracujem, ale hlavne hovoril o hypotezach, ktore on  sformuloval a povazoval za dolezite vyriesit. Podla mojich otazok a komentarov uberal alebo pridaval na obtiaznosti. Otukaval, ako daleko moze zajst. To bola dalsia vlastnost ktorou bol vychyreny; presne odhadnut schopnosti inych. Mal som velke stastie a v priebehu roka, po vynalozeni velkeho usilia, sa mi podarilo vyriesit tri z hypotez, ktore pri danom rozhovore Erdos spomenul. To zaroven vyriesilo aj problem aby si Erdos zapamatal moje meno. Po kratsej dobe som bol pozvany na svoj prvy pobyt v Severnej Amerike. Nebolo nic lepsie ako sa tam uviset prednaskou o rieseni Erdosovych problemov. Este pocas tohto pobytu som dostal pozvanie predniest danu prednasku na dalsich dvoch univerzitach v Canade. Dvere do sveta sa mi zacali vdaka Erdosovi otvarat. Riesenie Erdosovych problemov malo aj nematematicke dosledky. Pocas mojho dalsieho dlhodobeho pobytu v USA som sa rozhodol splnit si pubertalny sen pozriet sa na Havajske ostrovy. Cielom pobytu bolo overit, ci  Havajskym devam, odetym v style hore bez dole suknicka z listia, to listie v jeseni opada.  Vyskum zlyhal ale Havajske ostrovy mi pocarili. Chcel som sa tam vratit ale uz nie ako turista. Pre mna jedine schodna cesta bolo dostat miesto na University of Hawaii v Honolulu. Podarilo sa mi to len preto, lebo som netusil, ze sposob ako som na to isiel, nema nadej na uspech. Tak ako Fidel Castro isiel na lodi Granma s 80 spolubojovnikmi a 60 puskami dobyt Kubu. Tiez mu to vyslo len preto, ze si neuvedomoval, ze s danou posadkou nema najmensiu sancu vyhrat. Neznaly veci, ako to chodi vo velkom matematickom svete, som zobral telefonny zoznam, a ohlasil sa u veduceho katedry matematiky.  Po potriaseni ruk som povedal, ze som vyriesil tri Erdosove problemy a ci mozem u nich dostal miesto visiting profesora. Erdosovo meno zabralo, a odvtedy som uz na University of Hawaii stravil dohromady vyse roka.  Netvrdim, ze tieto pobyty dramaticky prispeli k mojmu odbornemu rastu. Nie kazdy je imunny ako Erdos voci ludskym slabostiam. V roku 1994 som mal Erdosa doma na navsteve tri dni. Dlhsie som ho viacmenej sam nedokazal intelektualne utiahnut. Prisli sme k nam o 11-tej vecer. Po prichode si umyl ruky, robil to denne aspon 10 krat a prehlasil okridlene \"My brain is open\". Ja som zacal okato zivat a chcel odlozit pracu na rano. Erdos si to nevsimal a zacal mi vysvetlovat matematicky problem. Okolo druhej rano som si isiel dat studenu sprchu. Stastie stalo pri mne a ja som priamo pod sprchou dostal napad, ktory viedol k rieseniu problemu.  Vdaka tomu som o pol hodiny bol v posteli. Zialbohu trik so sprchou uz nikdy viac nefungoval. Druhy den o 6-tej Erdos chodil po kuchyni a robil \"nenapadne\" hluk. Chvilu ho manzelka zamestnala ranajkami ale potom som uz musel celit realite. Poobede mal Erdos prednasku a po nej nas  viacero islo s nim na veceru. To mi pomohlo, cloveku ktory celu zivot intenzivne sportuje, pozbierat energiu, aby som stacil vetchemu clovekovi starsiemu o do mna o 40 rokov.  Posledny den Erdos odchadzal ihned po obede. Dovtedy sme samozrejme pracovali. Pytal som sa ho, ci sa chce prv najest alebo zabalit veci. Uprednostnil jedlo. Potom ma poziadal, aby som mu zbalil kufor. Po jeho odchode som vysledky nasej prace som spisal do formy clanku. V tej dobe som uz mal Erdosovo cislo jedna, ale to mohol byt clanok, na ktorom by sme boli jedini dvaja spoluatori. Coskoro sa vsak ukazalo, ze velmi podobne vysledky boli nedavno zverejnene niekym inym, a nedavalo zmysel publikovat nas clanok. Vyuzil som Erdosovu navstevu u nas aj na nematematicke debaty. Seley, ktory prvy popisal stres ako fyziologicky jav, a je po nom nazvana univerzita v Komarne, v jednej svojej knihe napisal: \"Spevak popularnej hudby chce uznanie davu. A cim vacsi je dav, tym lepsie. Avsak vedec chce uznanie piatich ludi, a samozrejme vie ich mena\". Vystiznejsie to  ani nejde sformulovat. Povedal som to Erdosovi a spytal sa ho, kto je na jeho zozname PIATICH. On vyhybavo odpovedal, ze ho tesi uznanie kazdeho dobreho matematika. Ja som vsak chcel poriadnu odpoved.  Erdos to po chvili vzdal a povedal: To vobec nie je dolezite. Zalezi jedine na tom, ci si ludia budu pamatat moje matematicke vysledky aj po 500 rokoch.V tej chvili som si jasne uvedomil jednu vec. Erdos bol  jediny medzi mojmi  znamymi,  ktory opravnene moze mat takuto ambiciu. On zrejme videl matematiku aj ako cestu k nesmrtelnosti.  Napokon, vela ludom sa to cez matematiku  podarilo. Vsetci pozname meno Phytagoras. Meno ministra prace, rodiny a socialnych veci zo starych Athen si nepamata nikto. Na mojom zozname PIATICH bolo v tom case Erdosovo meno pat krat. Preto nasledujuce povazujem za najvacsie ocenenie v mojom matematickom zivote. V roku 1995 som sa stretol s Erdosom posledny krat. Bolo to na konferencii v Prahe. On uz velmi nechodil na prednasky, a vacsinu casu stravil na chodbe pred prednaskovou miestnostou pri praci na otvorenych problemoch s inymi matematikmi. Ked som uz stal pri tabuli, pripraveny predniest moj prispevok, jeden z organizatorov konferencie poprosil o chvilu strpenia a povedal: Profesor Erdos ma poziadal aby som ho zavolal na Horakovu prednasku. Cela konferencia pockala nez sa Erdos, v tom case 82 rocny, pomalym, a neistym krokom presunul z chodby do saly. Prednasku som ukoncil formulaciou hypotezy o znamom invariante. Na to Erdos poznamenal: Budem o tom probleme premyslat. To uz bola cukrova poleva na mojej najkrajsej torte. Erdos hovoril, ze majetok je na obtiaz. A podla toho sa aj spraval. Cele jeho osobne vlastnictvo sa voslo do kufrika s ktorym cestoval po svete. Bolo v nom par suprav spodneho pradla, pyzama, par kosiel, vsetko rucne site a z praveho hodvabu. Kvoli nediagnostikovanej koznej chorobe Erdos nenosil nic ine. Okrem toho sveter  a zvysok kufra zaplnala odborna literatura.Mal jedny sandaly a kvoli plochym noham a slabym slacham aj vysoke snurovacie rucne site topanky, modne v roku 1935.  Nosil vzdy oblek, a obcas miesto kosle pyzamovy vrsok. Poslednych 30 rokov Erdosov jediny isty prijem bol mala suma, ktoru dostaval ako clen Madarskej akademie vied  v case ked sa zdrziaval v Budapesti. Vtedy byval v hostovskej izbe akademie. Do ich bytu po smrti matky uz v podstate nechodil. Temer vsetky peniaze, ktore dostal ako honorare za prednasky po celom svete alebo rozne ceny, rozdal. Ci uz na charitu, alebo malej rozhlasovej stanici vysielajucej vaznu hudbu, ktora stala pred bankrotom, na podporu lekarskeho vyskumu, nadanym studentom, ktori mali financne problemy, atd. Nikdy neobiesiel bezdomovca bez toho aby mu dal nejake peniaze.  Ked dostal prestiznu Wolfovu cenu, ktorej sucastou je $50,000, nechal si iba $720 a zvysok dal do nadacie pre studentov. Bol hlboko ludsky, a stale myslel na dobro mladych ludi. Po precitani popularneho clanoku o sebe povedal autorovi, ze nemal spomenut jeho bratie Benzedrinu. Konstatoval, ze je to sice pravda, ale nechce aby mladi ludia, ktori idu do matematiky, si mysleli ze musia brat drogy ak chcu uspiet. Mal velmi rad male deti. Casto sa pri nich pristavil a ukazoval im jednoduce triky s mincou. Zvlastnu naklonost mal k mimoriadne nadanym detom. Braval ich na obed o hovoril s nimi o matematike. Pocas Erdosovej navstevy u nas som bezal do nemocnice, kde zobrali mojho syna po uraze oka pri basketbale. O rok, ked som na to uz celkom zabudol, sa ma Erdos pytal, ci  je synov zrak v poriadku. Erdos nedbal na svetske statky, avsak co sa tyka osobnej slobody a slobody nazoru bol neustupny. Po kolapse Madarskej republiky rad, ked bol jeho otec este stale v sovietskom zajati, sa jeho matka obavala protizidovskych represii. Navrhla synovi aby sa dali pokrstit. Hoci mal Erdos iba sest rokov, povedal, aby urobila co uzna za vhodne, ale on ostane tym, cim sa narodil. Vela univerzit by sa rado pysilo tym, ze Erdos patri medzi jej profesorov. Kvoli tomu boli ochotni k velkym ustupkom. Najdalej zasla Notre Dame. Ponukli mu stale miesto u nich s tym, ze vzdy bude v zalohe pripraveny iny matematik, pre pripad ak dostane pocas ucenia matematicky napad a bude chciet odist z triedy Aj to sa vsak Erdosvi zdalo velke obmedzenie jeho slobody a ponuku odmietol napriek naliehaniu svojich priatelov. Nebol ochotny ku kompromisu ani pri jednani s uradmi. Hoci bol skutocne doma iba v Budapesti, do Madarska nevkrocil po dobu  viacerych rokov. To bol jeho forma protestu za to, ze neudelili viza niekolkym izraelskym matematekom a tak im znemoznili ucast na konferencii pri prilezitosti Erdosovych narodenin. Erdos sa casto stazoval, ze je stary. Nebal sa smrti, jeho obava bola, ze vekom sa zmensia jeho matematicke schopnosti, ze doslova ohlupne. Ked sa jeho zdravie zacalo  zhorsovat bral ze to ide s vekom. Raz mu padli okuliare na zem tak, ze jedno sklo sa rozbilo. On si ich opatovne nasadil a povedal: Na to oko uz aj tak nevidim. Problem s danym okom donutil Erdosovych priatelov jednat za neho. Zariadili, ze v univerzitnej nemocnici v Memphise mu bude transplantovana rohovka. Pred operaciou doktor Erdosovi podrobne vysvetlil proceduru, ktora trva asi dve hodiny. Erdos sa doktora opytal, ci bude moct citat. Samozrejme, odpovedal doktor; ved to bol zmysel operacie. Ked v operacnej miestnosti stisili svetla, Erdos bol vyvedeny z miery a pytal sa preco to urobili. Chirurg vysvetloval, ze iba takto moze operovat. \"Ale ved ste mi slubil, ze budem moct citat\", namietal Erdos. \"Iba jedno oko budem mat umrtvene, preco s tym druhym nemozem pozerat  matematicky casopis?\" Ked nebol ochotny ustupit, chirurg na hranici zufalstva telefonoval na katedru matematiky aby okamzite poslali niekoho kto sa bude s Erdosom pocas operacie rozpravat o matematike. Erdosovo srdce nebolo na tom ovela lepsie. Chip Ordman spomina ako prisiel Erdosa navstivit do nemocnice v Budapesti, kde lezal po mensom infarkte.  Do tejto nemocnice ho prelozili, lebo v povodnej nemali dost velku izbu aby sa tam zmestili vsetci navstevnici.  Vsade po izbe, aj v posteli boli stohy matematickych casopisov a clankov. Erdos simultanne pracoval na matematickom probleme s troma skupinami ludi. S jednymi sa rozpraval po madarsky, s dalsou po nemecky a s poslednou po anglicky. Zaroven konverzoval s navstevou. Do tohto blazinca vosiel lekar. Erdos ho razne poziadal aby prisiel o par hodin, lebo predsa vidi ze teraz pracuje. Lekar bez slova uposluchol. V juni 1996, par mesiacov pred smrtou, Erdos odpadol v momente, ked pocas konferencie v USA kladol otazku prednasatelovi. Este v to doobedie voperovali Erdosovi pacemaker.  Vecer uz bol Erdos na konferencnom bankete. Po kazdej strane mu sedel srdcovy chirurg. Erdos vstal, jemne sa uklonil a povedal: A teraz dovolte aby som dokoncil otazku. Moj priatel Zsolt Tuza z Madarskej Akademie vied, bol posledny kto videl Erdosa ziveho. Bolo to pocas konferencie vo Varsave. Po veceri isiel odprevadit Erdosa na izbu a ustlal mu postel. Erdos navrhol aby si sadli a robili este chvilu matematiku. Tuza sa ospravedlnil Pali bacimu, ze je uz neskoro, ze je unaveny; bol o 40 rokov mladsi ako Erdos. Povedal, ze mozu pokracovat    rano.  Erdos v noci zatelefonoval na recepciu, ze sa citi zle. Pokial prisli na jeho izbu, bolo po nom. Jeho jedina obava sa nenaplnila. Doslova do poslednej chvile robil matematiku; skvelu matenatiku. Pre nematematikov bol Erdos excentrikom. On pri pohlade zvonku asi tak skutocne vyzeral. Hemingway vravieval: \"Blazni su len preto blazni, lebo nas je viacej\". PS. Moja manzelka, matematicka, polozila otazku, ci tento clanok nie je prislis dlhy. Vyslovila hypotezu ze ho nikto nedocita do konca.

Networks grant CIA time to spin report The December 9 release of the executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee\'s report on CIA torture prompted substantial media coverage. But the network newscasts seemed to be guided by the need to apply something like an \"equal time\" rule for the torturers. Dec 05 2014 Lindsay Beyerstein on Rolling Stone Rape Controversy, Amitabh Pal on Bhopal What critics are missing about Rolling Stone\'s account of a shocking gang rape at the University of Virginia; and a report on the Union Carbide gas leak in Bhopal, India, a crime that killed thousands that is far from over. Dec 01 2014 Ebola Story Puts Old Fears in New Virus Behind media obsession, a sad old story of poverty and priorities By Janine Jackson Ebola is less a story about a bizarre new disease and its unpredictably disastrous capacities, and more a sad old story about poverty and priorities. Dec 01 2014 Having Their Hate and Defeating Dems Too At Fox News Latino, immigrants go from target to target audience By Aldo Guerrero Fox News Channel pander to xenophobic white conservatives with fear-mongering about Latino immigrants, while Fox News Latino brings Latinos to the Republican Party with feel-good coverage of Latino conservatives. Nov 28 2014 Maegan Ortiz on Immigration Action, Hannah Guzik on Fracking the Poor This week on CounterSpin: Obama\'s executive action on immigration has rightwing Republicans calling for impeachment, or at least censure, or at least defunding of any agencies involved in implementing it. So does that mean it\'s good? We\'ll hear from media maker and organizer Maegan Ortiz on what media\'s overwhelmingly inside the beltway framing leaves out. Also this week: Fracking is often portrayed in the corporate media as many steps in the right direction: Energy independence, job creation, not to mention homeowners striking it rich. But a new investigation in In These Times magazine shows that poverty and drilling go hand in hand. We\'ll talk to journalist Hannah Guzik about environmental racism and the fight to find out the public health risks associated with fracking. Nov 21 2014 Mariame Kaba on Ferguson, Daphne Wysham on US/China Climate Deal This week on CounterSpin: The imminent ruling by a St. Louis County grand jury about whether to indict Darren Wilson, the police officer who killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, has media focused on the possibility of violent demonstrations. But the issues raised by Brown\'s killing won\'t disappear no matter what the jury decides. We\'ll talk with educator and organizer Mariame Kaba about the bigger story. Also this week: The White House\'s climate emissions deal with China was praised throughout the media as a big step in the right direction. One liberal columnist told readers not to listen to the \'yes but\' naysayers. But critics of the deal are worth listening to; we\'ll speak with one, Daphne Wysham of the Center for Sustainable Economy. Nov 14 2014 No Debate and the New War Study finds little opposition to US attacks on Iraq, Syria In the run-up to the US military attacks in Iraq and Syria, US media presented almost no debate on whether the country should go to war. Nov 14 2014 Lori Wallach on TPP, Ari Berman on Voting Rights This week on CounterSpin: Bipartisanship and free trade are two of corporate media\'s favorite things, so when the Washington Post editorial expressed the post midterm media consensus--\"Now that Republicans have gained control of Congress, no policy area is riper for bipartisan action than trade\"--you can believe they were happy to do it. But should we be happy? And is it even true? We\'ll hear from Lori Wallach of Public Citizen\'s Global Trade Watch. Also this week: Republicans have been hard at work for the past few years restricting the right to vote. Did their work pay off in the midterms? We\'ll speak to reporter Ari Berman of The Nation, who recently wrote that \"it\'s become easier to buy an election and harder to vote in one.\" Next Page» Search this Site Get FAIR’s Action Alerts Tweets by @FAIRmediawatch Top Posts & Pages Equal Time for Torturers?

Site by nigelparry.netBoondocks.net Search Primary Menu Skip to content Boondocks Fan Central Boondocks Books Season 1 Season 3 Privacy Contact Search for: Fan Site Watch The Boondocks – a Successful Modern Satire The Aaron McGruder comic strip comes to life in the animated TV series The Boondocks.  Brothers Riley and Huey Freeman find it challenging to mesh their culture with that of the Chicago suburbs when they move in with their grandfather.  The duo has a way of stirring up trouble in their new neighborhood, but Granddad Robert Freeman is just eccentric enough to keep the young boys in line.  With roughly 8 years worth of comic strip archives to work from, The Boondocks provided plenty of material for a weekly, animated TV show.  If you’ve missed it on television, you can now watch The Boondocks episodes for free online. Target Audience Despite its animated format, The Boondocks is appropriate for a more mature audience, and therefore airs during the “Adult Swim” block of programming on the Cartoon Network.  Much of the humor is derived from references to current events, political leaders, and a strong left-wing take on topics like terrorism and race relationships that may be inappropriate or fail to appeal to younger viewers.  For this reason, you and your family should watch The Boondocks responsibly.  Note that the episodes may air in slightly censored format for television and that the episodes on DVD are unrated. Conflict & Controversy As anyone who has had a chance to watch The Boondocks can tell you, the subject matter tends to be controversial.  In fact, scenes and entire episodes have been banned from airing, and can only be found on the DVDs of the show.  The satire is risqué in nature, uses language that some may find offensive, and often pokes fun at public figures and politicians.  Condoleezza Rice and Larry Elder are among the many celebrities whom McGruder has taken jabs at through the cartoon.  The issues that arise in The Boondocks spark healthy conversations and challenge viewers to be more responsible consumers of the news and media. The unapologetic satire is what draws in many viewers to watch The Boondocks, but it also raises problems for the television stations that air the show, and McGruder has even received hate mail addressing some of his strong opinions.  The Boondocks made the Time Magazine top ten list of the most controversial cartoons of all time, along with South Park, The Simpsons, and Family Guy. Where to Watch The Boondocks The Boondocks premiered on television in 2005 and after several hiatus’ is back on the air with Season 4 so you can look forward to another year of episodes to watch, starting in late April 2014 with updates right here on Boondocks.net.  The Boondocks is an award-winning series that maintains a strong fan base and continues to win over new viewers with each episode aired.  You can watch The Boondocks on Adult Swim in the US, or various Cartoon or Comedy channels around the world.  The first two seasons have been released on DVD, and you also have the option to watch The Boondocks online to catch any episodes you’ve missed.

The Boondocks – a Successful Modern Satire The Aaron McGruder comic strip comes to life in the animated TV series The Boondocks.  Brothers Riley and Huey Freeman find it challenging to mesh their culture with that of the Chicago suburbs when they move in with their grandfather.  The duo has a way of stirring up trouble in their new neighborhood, but Granddad Robert Freeman is just eccentric enough to keep the young boys in line.  With roughly 8 years worth of comic strip archives to work from, The Boondocks provided plenty of material for a weekly, animated TV show.  If you’ve missed it on television, you can now watch The Boondocks episodes for free online. Target Audience Despite its animated format, The Boondocks is appropriate for a more mature audience, and therefore airs during the “Adult Swim” block of programming on the Cartoon Network.  Much of the humor is derived from references to current events, political leaders, and a strong left-wing take on topics like terrorism and race relationships that may be inappropriate or fail to appeal to younger viewers.  For this reason, you and your family should watch The Boondocks responsibly.  Note that the episodes may air in slightly censored format for television and that the episodes on DVD are unrated. Conflict & Controversy As anyone who has had a chance to watch The Boondocks can tell you, the subject matter tends to be controversial.  In fact, scenes and entire episodes have been banned from airing, and can only be found on the DVDs of the show.  The satire is risqué in nature, uses language that some may find offensive, and often pokes fun at public figures and politicians.  Condoleezza Rice and Larry Elder are among the many celebrities whom McGruder has taken jabs at through the cartoon.  The issues that arise in The Boondocks spark healthy conversations and challenge viewers to be more responsible consumers of the news and media. The unapologetic satire is what draws in many viewers to watch The Boondocks, but it also raises problems for the television stations that air the show, and McGruder has even received hate mail addressing some of his strong opinions.  The Boondocks made the Time Magazine top ten list of the most controversial cartoons of all time, along with South Park, The Simpsons, and Family Guy. Where to Watch The Boondocks The Boondocks premiered on television in 2005 and after several hiatus’ is back on the air with Season 4 so you can look forward to another year of episodes to watch, starting in late April 2014 with updates right here on Boondocks.net.  The Boondocks is an award-winning series that maintains a strong fan base and continues to win over new viewers with each episode aired.  You can watch The Boondocks on Adult Swim in the US, or various Cartoon or Comedy channels around the world.  The first two seasons have been released on DVD, and you also have the option to watch The Boondocks online to catch any episodes you’ve missed.

To Become a Sage is a translation of Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning by Yi T\'oegye (1501-1570) Translated, with extensive annotation and commentary, By Michael C. Kalton Published by Columbia University Press, 1988 Calligraphy for diagrams by Margaret C. Kalton Neo-Confucianism: The synthesis of Taoist cosmology and Buddhist spirituality around the core of Confucian concern with society and government, a synthesis which predominated in the intellectual and spiritual life of China, Korea, and Japan prior to the modern period.

Basically it is split down the middle: the first five chapters present the essential framework, \"based on the Tao of Heaven,\" as he says. They include a description of the universe (metaphysics), society (ethics), and their import for human life (learning). The remaining five chapters deal directly with self?cultivation, the \"learning of the mind?and­-heart.\" They begin with an analysis and characterization of man\'s inner life (psychology) and conclude with concrete practice (ascetical theory).36 Or from a slightly different perspective, the chapters on learning are the core of the whole work; the first two chapters present the great foundation which must be properly understood and the later chapters detail the fruition of learning in the actual process of self­cultivation.37 This perspective brings out the underlying unity of the two halves of the Ten Diagrams, in which intellectual considerations and moral practice are the interdependent and dialectically related facets of the single process of self, transformation called learning. T\'oegye makes a special point of this in his remarks presenting the Ten Diagrams to King S?njo. T\'oegye explicitly makes mindfulness (ky?ng, ching) the central theme of the whole Ten Diagrams.38 It is absolutely fundamental for both study and practice. On the side of intellectual investigation, it stands for the mental recollection and concentration necessary for such pursuits. As for moral practice, the same mental recollection is a token of the self?possession and reverential seriousness that are the basis of a sound and proper response to the world around us. The final two chapters are devoted entirely to the topic of mindfulness, but it is a constant subject throughout the other chapters as well. Most of the material used for the first five chapters, those dealing with the basic framework, are so fundamental and well known as to be virtually self?selecting. The Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate, the Western Inscription, and the Great Learning certainly are such. In Korea, as in Yüan China, the Elementary Learning was esteemed as a classic, so pairing it with the Great Learning was also a matter of course. The rules Chu Hsi wrote for his White Deer Hollow Academy were likewise well known, being inscribed on the walls of Korea\'s own Confucian Academy. But to extend the discussion of learning to three chapters by including them is a bit surprising. One explanation may be T\'oegye\'s great concern with these issues, which were currently being seriously challenged in China by the Lu?Wang school. Further motivation may have been T\'oegye\'s concern for private academies, a Neo?Confucian institution that with his help was just getting un­derway in Korea. Personal preference played a larger role in compiling the last five chapters which deal with the learning of the mind?and?heart. This was a fundamental aspect of the Ch\'eng?Chu school, but by nature it was more diffuse and personal and did not crystallize into universally recognized reference points such as the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate. Chen Te?hsiu\'s Classic of the Mind?and?Heart was, of course, a major reference point for T\'oegye. It\'s influence is clear in the central position accorded mindfulness throughout the Ten Diagrams, and the Diagram of the Study of the Mind and Heart (chapter 8) prefaces the Classic as an expression of the essence of the work. Chu Hsi\'s Admonition for Mindfulness Studio (chapter 9) likewise appears in its pages. Chu Hsi\'s famous Treatise on Jen does not appear in the Classic itself, but it epitomizes a formulation of jen (humanity) that was prominent in the thought of Chen Te?hsiu and occupied an important position in the Classic. The sixth chapter, however, merits special attention. Chen\'s Classic avoided intellectualism, but T\'oegye here reintroduces it to the learning of the mind?and?heart by a chapter that serves to establish a metaphysical framework for man\'s inner life. It is actually three diagrams, each with its own text. The first is a fairly standard pre­sentation of basic Ch\'eng?Chu psychological theory. The second and third, however, are T\'oegye\'s unique contribution, a summation, in effect, of his final position in the Four?Seven Debate. In an unprec­edented way they undertake a metaphysical analysis of the function      Psychology Psychology, the theory of the dynamic structure and function of the human mind-and-heart, is an area of central concern in Neo-Confucian thought. Psychological theory draws heavily upon the metaphysical/cosmological framework (cf. Chapter One) and determines the approach to the all-important matter of self-cultivation (cf. Chapters Eight, Nine, and Ten).

An Essay on the Origin of Consciousness Green Spirituality: Horizontal Transcendence Ecozoic Evolution?Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning   The Ten Diagrams is T\'oegye\'s last great work, and of all his writings it has perhaps been the best known and most popular. It went through some twenty?nine printings during the Yi dynasty, and now circulates in at least three modern Korean translations. Generally regarded as expressing the essence of T\'oegye\'s learning, it is at once profound and fundamental. Generations of students have appreciated the clarity with which this brief work presents the essential framework and basic linkages of Neo?Confucian metaphysics, psychological the­ory, and ascetical practice. Mature scholars returned to it continually for the subtlety, balance, and soundness of this integral presentation of the vision by which they lived. This is indeed a summation of what T\'oegye thought it essential to understand. He composed it in 1568 to leave behind with the young King S?njo as he retired. Worn out and ill, he could not continue to instruct the king, and the Ten Diagrams was his substitute for the teaching he could no longer offer in person. Its composition was by no means an erudite research project, though it expresses the learning of a lifetime. The old teacher carefully arranged and ordered materials he had long used in his teaching and personal life, weaving them together to encompass the scope of a learning by then self?evident to him. \"Sage Learning\" is a term frequently used in a genre of Neo­Confucian literature designed for the instruction of rulers. Its usage reflects the particular duty of the ruler to learn from and model himself after the ideal sage rulers of the past. The circumstances of its origin clearly place the Ten Diagrams within this provenance. This fact is somewhat misleading, however, for as T\'oegye himself says, when it comes to questions of learning and self?cultivation, there is no essential difference between the ruler and everyman. The king needs particular kinds of knowledge to govern, but Confucians traditionally considered the essential learning for all government to be the cultivation of oneself as a full and proper human being, and it is to this that the Ten Diagrams is addressed. While it belongs to the learning of rulers, \"sage learning\" also had a particular place in the new kind of learning developed by Neo­Confucians. In a famous passage in his T\'ung?shu (a chapter itself entitled \"Sage Learning\") Chou Tun?i put the question, \"Can one learn to become a sage?\" He answered with a resounding \"Yes!\" and set out to explain how. This reflects a new and important development. Traditionally Confucians had affirmed that any man could become a sage, but had let it remain a theoretical ideal. Now they elaborated a metaphysical, psychological, and ascetical framework that showed the path to sagehood, making this lofty ideal as realistic and immediate as was enlightenment for the Buddhist. The term \"sage learning\" in T\'oegye\'s title signifies his intent to present that framework and path. The Ten Diagrams is an extremely compressed work, more a distillation of the essential elements of the Ch\'eng?Chu vision than an exposition of them. The commentary that accompanies this trans­lation (i.e. To Become a Sage) draws heavily on T\'oegye\'s more expository writings to fill in the background modern readers will need. The format of the Ten Diagrams is ten sections or chapters. Each begins with a diagram and related text drawn from Chu Hsi or other leading authorities, and concludes with a few brief remarks by T\'oegye. The brevity is in part due to his intention that it be made into a ten?paneled standing screen as well as a short book. The brief format and the idea of presenting it on a screen are closely related to the purpose of the Ten Diagrams. It is intended for repeated reading and reflection. In moments of leisure the eye could play over the screen and the mind be gently but constantly engaged with its contents, so that one might finally totally assimilate this material and make it a part of himself. T\'oegye sees the structure of the Ten Diagrams in several ways. Basically it is split down the middle: the first five chapters present the essential framework, \"based on the Tao of Heaven,\" as he says. They include a description of the universe (metaphysics), society (ethics), and their import for human life (learning). The remaining five chapters deal directly with self?cultivation, the \"learning of the mind?and­-heart.\" They begin with an analysis and characterization of man\'s inner life (psychology) and conclude with concrete practice (ascetical theory).36 Or from a slightly different perspective, the chapters on learning are the core of the whole work; the first two chapters present the great foundation which must be properly understood and the later chapters detail the fruition of learning in the actual process of self­cultivation.37 This perspective brings out the underlying unity of the two halves of the Ten Diagrams, in which intellectual considerations and moral practice are the interdependent and dialectically related facets of the single process of self, transformation called learning. T\'oegye makes a special point of this in his remarks presenting the Ten Diagrams to King S?njo.   See also: Sources and Arrangement of Ten Diagrams   Chinese text      Michael C.

Notes Glossary Selected Bibliography IndexNeo-Confucianism Neo-Confucianism: The synthesis of Taoist cosmology and Buddhist spirituality around the core of Confucian concern with society and government, a synthesis which predominated in the intellectual and spiritual life of China, Korea, and Japan prior to the modern period. History 1) Confucianism: There were two interrelated facets in the tradition founded by Confucius (551-479 B.C.): government and proper social order were a major concern on the one hand, and on the other it presented a profound vision of the qualities and modes of conduct necessary to be a full and worthy human being. These were intimately linked, for in the Confucian view morality or humanity consisted primarily in the cultivation and conduct of proper social relationships, and the essence of government was morality. Confucius was China\'s first private educator. His role was to train young men for service in government and his most fundamental conviction was that the essen­tial preparation for such service must be character formation: true learning was moral learning, and society should be ruled (ordered) by a meritocracy based on such learning. During the Han dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) this classical Confucian core was effectively synthesized with elements of what had originally been competing schools of thought, most notably the cos­mological speculations of the Yin-Yang and Five Agents philosophies. Man, society, and government were woven together with the cosmos in a complex system of correspondences that described an all-encom­passing underlying order, a fitting reflection of the unity of the great Chinese empire. But the vision that reflected the success of the Han dynasty became less plausible when Chinese society again slid toward chaos as the dynasty declined. In the minds of many the malfunction and disorder of the last decades of the Han discredited not only the gov­ernment, but the ideology that had been sponsored by the government and legitimated it. China was ready for something new. In the centuries of disorder and division that followed the collapse of the Han, Indian Buddhism competed with a resurgent religious Taoism for predominance. The foreign tradition brought with it a metaphysical and ascetical sophis­tication hitherto unknown in China, and as the Chinese came to understand and appreciate these doctrines Buddhism became a magnet for the best minds and most profound spirits. Confucianism as a con­ventional social morality or a form of learning associated with gov­ernment service was commonly regarded as a complement to the more profound philosophy and spirituality of Buddhism. But its approach to self-cultivation through good habits and self-discipline seemed mun­dane and banal in comparison with an enlightenment to be achieved through the inner discipline of meditation; its cosmology looked like naive commonsense in comparison with the metaphysics of emptiness, one mind, all-in-one-one-in-all, and the like with which the various Buddhist schools supported their meditative disciplines. 2) Neo-Confucianism: Buddhism reached a creative and flourishing peak during the Tang dynasty (618-907); but the Sung dynasty (979-1279) saw a reaction to the \"foreign\" religion and a creative revitalization of the stagnant Confucian tradition. In the political world this took the form of a reform movement which attempted to address the pressing socio­economic problems of the day by a creative reinterpretation of ancient ideal Confucian institutions. But of more lasting importance was the intellectual and spiritual reshaping of the tradition. In a milieu long shaped by Buddhist predominance, men again began to take the Con­fucian classics seriously. Not surprisingly, they found what they were looking for: a long \"lost\" ascetical doctrine dealing with the cultivation of the inner life of the mind, and a metaphysics that could frame this with a philosophical account of sagehood, self-cultivation, and, ul­timately, the universe. The morphology of this renewed or \"neo\" Confucian vision equals the compass and scope of Buddhism. It was effected, however, not by borrowing, but by a creative reinterpretation of the traditional Confucian core to meet new intellectual and spiritual expectations. It answers the Buddhist transcendence of the mundane by transcen­dentally grounding the mundane: human interpersonal relationships and concern for society and government are inseparably united with deepened ascetical practice as the path to ultimate personal fulfillment. There are Neo-Confucian retreats, but no Neo-Confucian monasteries. 3) The Founders: The four main architects of this new vision during the early years were Chou Tun-i (1017-1073), Chang Tsai (1020-1077), and his nephews, the brothers Ch\'eng Hao (1032-1083) and Ch\'eng I (1033-1108). Chou\'s Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate appears in chap­ter 1 of the Ten Diagrams; it became the cornerstone of Neo-Confucian metaphysics. Chang Tsai elaborated a monistic metaphysics based, like Chou\'s Diagram, on the Book of Changes. Although his meta­physical system was largely supplanted by that developed by his neph­ews, his work was of seminal importance for Neo-Confucian psychological theory.2 Confucian ethics was reestablished on a me­taphysical foundation by his famous essay, The Western Inscription, which appears in chapter 2. The Ch\'eng brothers were responsible for the introduction of the concept li, \"principle,\" which became the pivot point of Neo-Confucian metaphysics, psychology, and ascetical doctrine. 4) Chu Hsi and Wang Yang-ming The central figure in this Confucian revival, however, was Chu Hsi (1130-1200). He creatively synthesized the rather disparate contributions of these earlier thinkers into a coherent, powerful vision. His commentaries on the Four Books3 wove a classical foundation for this vision so persuasively that in 1313 his interpretation was made normative for the civil service examinations. The Ch\'eng-Chu school, so called because of the centrality of the Ch\'engs\' contribution to Chu Hsi\'s system, thus achieved the status of an officially sanctioned orthodoxy. Though it maintained this central position down to the modern era, the Ch\'eng-Chu school was not the only school of Neo-Confucian thought. The most notable alternative was the school of Wang Yang-­ming (1472-1529), often referred to as the \"Lu-Wang school\" because Wang\'s thought bore a marked similarity to the ideas of Chu Hsi\'s contemporary and rival, Lu Chiu-yüan (Hsiang-shan 1139-1193). The \"Lu-Wang school\" equated mind with li or principle and so followed an approach to self-cultivation that was based on the mind\'s direct intuitive grasp of the proper way, as opposed to the Ch\'eng-Chu emphasis on the need for diligent study or \"the inves­tigation of things.\" Chu Hsi\'s school vehemently rejected this as a form of Ch\'an (Zen) Buddhism decked out in Confucian garb, but the Lu-Wang school became a strong movement, overshadowing the orthodox tradition throughout the remainder of the Ming period. That it found no equal acceptance or popularity in Korea constitutes one of the most obvious of the important differences between the subse­quent Chinese and Korean traditions. 5) The Four Books The Neo-Confucian movement developed metaphysical and ascetical dimensions essential to revitalizing the Confucian tradition. In the course of this, it also reshaped the classical canon as attention focused particularly on works which spoke to these new concerns. The Great Learning was extricated from its obscure position in the volu­minous Book of Rites to become the most authoritative description of the process of self-cultivation. Another section of the Book of Rites, the Doctrine of the Mean, likewise attained new prominence as an independent classic; it furnished vital elements of a metaphysically grounded psychological theory and a depiction of sagehood. The Men­cius, long well known but ancillary to the classical corpus, now became one of the most important classical authorities; more than any other ancient source, it spoke to Neo-Confucian concerns regarding the mind, human nature, and cultivation of the inner life. The Analects, the classic containing the words of Confucius himself recorded by his direct disciples, remained, as always, fundamental: the Sung Confu­cians understood themselves as finally recovering the full meaning of the ancient deposit of sage wisdom, and it was necessary that the words of the Master himself inform and sanction their vision. These four texts, collectively referred to as \"the Four Books,\" became the new core of the Confucian canon; intensively studied, analyzed, and de­bated, they furnished much of the substance and vocabulary of Neo-­Confucian discourse.Ethics          Neo-Confucians gave traditional Confucian ethics a new metaphysical foundation. The document which most powerfully crystallized this transformation was Chang Tsai\'s Western Inscription. Chang\'s brief essay so successfully wove together the new with the old that it became the classic reference point for Neo-Confucian ethics. T\'oegye presents the Western Inscription  as Chapter Two of the Ten Diagrams, accompanied by the comments of Chu Hsi and other Chinese Neo-Confucians, and his own remarks. The Commentary takes up the following topics:                     Confucian Ethics on a New Foundation                             The Substance of Humanity                                           Weaving a New Cloth of Old Threads                               Principle as Objective Norm and Subjective Identity.   Chapter One lays out the metaphysical/cosmic framework of these ethics. Chapter Seven most clearly evidences the new dimensions metaphysics introduced into traditional ethical thinking.      Neo-Confucianism: the 21st Century Interface  When I committed myself to the study of East Asian traditions more than three decades ago, I had hopes that, in addition to helping me understand the societies of East Asia more deeply, this alternative world view would interface creatively with western assumptions about humans and the world that seemed to have reached a dead end. Since then, fed especially by developments in cybernetics, computers and information theory, and by environmental and life sciences, science has developed an increasingly sophisticated understanding of self-organizing complex holistic systems.

He intended it as a presentation of the most fundamental values and teachings of the Confucian tradition for the instruction of the young. It became the gateway to serious study for generations thereafter, and in Korea was considered virtually one of the Classics.                 Chinese text   Chapter Four: Diagram of the Great Learning. The Great Learning became one of the Four Books, the core of the revised Neo-Confucian canon of Classics. For Neo-Confucians it became the text that describes a path of self-cultivation which incorporates the new philosophy and leads to the ultimate perfection of Sagehood.                 Chinese text   Chapter Five: Diagram of the Rules of the White Deer Hollow Academy. The third and last chapter on Learning, these rules composed by Chu Hsi structurally integrate the Elementary Learning and the Great Learning.                 Chinese text   Chapter Six: Diagram of \"The Mind Combines and Governs the Nature and the Feelings.\" A presentation of Neo-Confucian psychological theory, including Korean developments. Beginning with T\'oegye, Korean scholars pushed the inquiry into this area of Neo-Confucian thought further than it was taken in either China or Japan.                 Chinese text   Chapter Seven: Diagram of Chu Hsi\'s Explanation of Humanity. Humanity (jen) is the virtue of virtues in the Confucian tradition. Neo-Confucian metaphysics explicated in a new way the unity of man and the universe, and this invited new thinking about jen that moved decisively beyond traditional formulations. The new thinking is crystallized in Chu Hsi\'s famous Explanation.                 Chinese text   Chapter Eight: Diagram of the Study of the Mind. T\'oegye takes this diagram from a work that influenced him profoundly, Chen Te-hsiu\'s Classic of the Mind-and-Heart. He uses it here as both an introduction and summation of Neo-Confucian ascetical doctrine, the method of cultivating one\'s mind-and-heart, which is the central concern of Chen\'s Classic.                 Chinese text   Chapter Nine: Diagram of the Admonition for Mindfulness Studio. Mindfulness is a technique and practice that stands at the center of this approach to the cultivation of the mind-and-heart. It occupies a central position in the diagrams of the last three chapters (8-10), but receives its full thematic treatment in this chapter.                 Chinese text   Chapter Ten: Diagram of the Admonition on \"Rising Early and Retiring Late.\" This chapter describes the practice of mindfulness in the context of the fluctuating rhythm of a typical day. Having begun in Chapter One with the grand cosmic framework, we conclude the Ten Diagrams with a depiction of a well-lived day.                 Chinese text        Neo-Confucianism: the 21st Century Interface  When I committed myself to the study of East Asian traditions more than three decades ago, I had hopes that, in addition to helping me understand the societies of East Asia more deeply, this alternative world view would interface creatively with western assumptions about humans and the world that seemed to have reached a dead end. Since then, fed especially by developments in cybernetics, computers and information theory, and by environmental and life sciences, science has developed an increasingly sophisticated understanding of self-organizing complex holistic systems. For the West, this is a new and exciting way of thinking, an alternative to the mechanistic linear causality that has dominated western thought for the last 300 years. It\'s proponents include a broad range of disciplines and areas of inquiry, from the most theoretical reaches of cosmology and physics to the life sciences, and most especially the environmental advocates who intensely urge our self-absorbed society to find a way of life sustainable within the living system to which we belong.   The emergence of ecological and whole systems thinking enriches the potential interface with the Neo-Confucian tradition in ways I never could have expected. Contemporary holistic systems theory and traditional Ch\'eng-Chu thought share an assumed naturalism and a causal theory that frames existence as essentially relational and self-organizing. But the development of these two bodies of thought has been quite asymmetrical. On the one hand, Ch\'eng-Chu thought has not met thephysics, chemistry, and life-science at the heart of contemporary holistic systems understanding. On the other, contemporary holistic systems understanding is in its infancy when it comes to ethical dimensions and spiritual cultivation--the very elements that were the central concerns animating Neo-Confucian thinkers. This asymmetry presents the potential for strong creative interaction.  For the last ten years my attention has turned almost entirely to an exploration of this interface. The papers made available here were presented at a variety of national and international conferences. They fall into roughly three groups: Updating the tradition: Two of these papers explore how a serious encounter with contemporary systems theory would modify the Neo-Confucian anthropocosmic vision, and whether Neo-Confucian social and moral self-cultivation could survive the transformation. Extending the Neo-Confucian Tradition: Questions and Reconceptualization for the Twenty-first Century Chong Tasan and Mencius: Towards a Contemporary East-West Interface A third reverses the question, asking what would become of science in an intellectual East Asian milieu that was again seriously engaged with its intellectual and spiritual heritage: Natural Science and Asian Religions: The Future of Belonging to the Earth Critical Insights: These three papers take the environmental crisis as the central question of our time, and ask what the Neo-Confucian tradition in general, and its Korean development in particular, might have to offer us as we confront this question. These papers involve some overlap, but contintinually experiment with framing and reformulating traditional concepts and questions in a way that brings out their relevance for contemporary concerns. T\'oegye\'s Neo-Confucianism and Survival in the 21st Century Origins: Confucian Stories and 21st Century Questions T\'oegye and Hope in the 21st Century In a Contemporary Voice: These three papers explore how a thinker versed both in the Neo-Confucian tradition and in contemporary systems theory might address major contemporary questions. There is no overt reference to Neo-Confucian sources: they function more as inspiration for the way I frame and address questions than as a source of borrowed concepts--a more profound but less evident form of influence. The first traces the evolutionary emergence of human consciousness, seeking to understand how and why it seems to present such a problematic fit with the rest of the natural world from which it emerged and to which it belongs. The second looks for a spirituality that can sustain our hope and joy in our temporary participation in a radically contingent universe--assuming an admission of our own contingency is germane to grasping the real dimensions of the environmental crisis. The third addresses the question of cultural evolution, asking whether it offers any support for those who see some kind of new evolutionary stage (an \"ecozoic era\") of human civilization as necessary if we are to become a sustainable species. An Essay on the Origin of Consciousness Green Spirituality: Horizontal Transcendence Ecozoic Evolution?Spirituality          The \"two wheels on the chariot\" of the Neo-Confucian approach to spiritual cultivation are Learning (Study) and Practice.   Learning includes but goes well beyond studying books, for Confucians always have viewed \"true learning\" as essentially a matter of character formation.  T\'oegye devotes three chapters of the Ten Diagrams. Chapters Three, Four, and Five, to this important topic. The third and fourth chapters review two of the most important references for understanding Learning, the Elementary Learning and the classic Great Learning. The fifth chapter takes up the systematic question of how to go about study and relate it to practical self-cultivation. The Commentary on Chapter Five includes the following topics:            On the Essence of Learning                                          How to Read a Book                                                  On Neo?Confucians and Worldly Confucians                      Learning and the Political World                                     On Private Academies in Korea.                                                  Practice interfaces with Learning and extends into considerations of spiritual discipline as it applies to both meditative cultivation and to one\'s conduct throughout daily life. T\'oegye devotes a further three chapters to this topic: Chapters Eight, Nine, and Ten. Chapter Ten takes us through the course of a well-lived day. Chapters Eight and Nine describe the essential discipline of the life of the mind-and-heart. The Commentary on Chapter Eight includes the following topics:            The Human Mind and the Mind of the Tao                       The Essence of Cultivating the Mind?and?Heart.   The Commentary on Chapter Nine includes:            The Centrality of Mind and Its Cultivation                       Mindfulness through Propriety: Beginning from             the External                                                        Mindfulness as Recollection and Self?Possession                 Mindfulness as Reverence.      For the psychological theory that constitutes the essential framework for this understanding of how to go about spiritual cultivation, see Chapter Six.                                                 Neo-Confucian Discourse            To Become a Sage, especially in a format that allows the powerful search function of contemporary word processing programs, is an extraordinary source for scholars, and particularily for graduate students grappling with the Neo-Confucian tradition, especially in its Establishment, Ch\'eng-Chu form. Ch\'eng-Chu discourse is heavily laced with phrases that reference not only well-known classical sources but also the extended body of discussion and controversy directly and indirectly relating to those texts. Work in primary sources often involves hours and days trying to run down the original locus of a discussion or the source of what was for the Ch\'eng-Chu school a common-place saying or phrase.            Because it aims to present a synoptic view of the entire scope of the Ch\'eng-Chu Neo-Confucian vision utilizing as its material its major reference points, the Ten Diagrams is a fabric woven from  the main threads of Neo-Confucian discourse. The Commentary takes up many of those threads, which can be easily spotted by scanning the headings listed in the Table of Contents. The Notes are a mine of references to the sources of the most commonly repeated phrases, sayings, and classical references in Ch\'eng-Chu metaphysics/cosmology, psychology, and theory of self-cultivation. The Index is rich in the categories and subcategories of the entire discourse. While you might not want to download the whole book, the notes and index are relatively small files and would be a good quick reference for short biographies of major Ch\'eng-Chu thinkers in China and Korea and to locate sources and references on major Ch\'eng-Chu topics.            These are, of course, the rudiments of the scholarly apparatus of any monograph. I draw special attention to them here because the extraordinary scope of T\'oegye\'s project in composing the Ten Diagrams makes the scholarly apparatus of this book exactly the kind of thing I longed for  when I was myself trying to find my way into the heavily textured conversation among Neo-Confucian literati.    About the web version           This site provides access to the complete text of  To Become a Sage, the copyright reverting to the author after it went out of print with Columbia University Press. It has been scanned into text files rather than PDF, so that files containing each chapter can be loaded to disk rather than just printed out. As a tool for scholarly purposes, a searchable version on disk has far more potential than hardcopy--or will be a very useful adjunct to a hardcopy version. In order to keep the annotations and other embedded references useful, original pagination is embedded in the text, set off by a double space line, even though it proved impossible to preserve the physical pagination of the original.           Footnote numbers are no longer superscripted. The original book had all footnotes only at the end of the book. In this version, I have included that all-inclusive section of notes, and have also appended the relevant notes to the end of each chapter, so whatever chapter you may choose to download will be accompanied by the appropriate notes. Likewise, in addition to the comprehensive Table of Contents, I have copied the appropriate Content headings to the front of each chapter to facilitate reference.           For reference, a copy of the original Chinese text has also been made available.          S?nghak sipto (Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning)   Chinese text           Source: Tosan ch?ns?

Neo-Confucianism was adopted as the official orthodoxy at the foundation of the Chos?n dynasty in 1392. The rich synthesis of a metaphysical system of Taoist proportions, meditative cultivation of consciousness reminiscent of Buddhist practice which Chu Hsi and other early Neo-Confucians wove about the core of traditional Confucian concerns for government and proper social ethics provided wide scope for varied and uneven development. During the first century activists in government focused on institutional reform while far from the capitol scholars in the countryside concentrated on the more meditative and self-cultivation oriented features of Neo-Confucian learning.  The differing orientations crystallized into bloody clashes and purges by the end of the fourteenth century as young men steeped in moral rigorism began to move from the countryside into government.  T\'oegye\'s comprehensive grasp of Chu Hsi\'s thought clarified the balance between activity and quiet, government and retired self-cultivation, and by the end of his life it was his disciples who were moving into high government positions. A year before his death he crystallized and presented to the king his understanding of the way metaphysics and psychological structures inform ascetical theory and  eventuate in the conduct of daily life. This work, the Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning (S?nghak sipdo) became one of the most famous and influential works of Korean Neo-Confucianism.  After T\'oegye it was no longer possible to deny the legitimacy of intensive, almost monastic devotion to study and meditative self-cultivation when the situation permitted, nor to ignore that the proper fruition of such formation should be the proper conduct of government and the ordering of society. On the level of philosophical theory T\'oegye left a lasting imprint on Korean Neo-Confucianism, for his \"four-seven debate,\" carried on in correspondence with a younger scholar, Ki Taes?ng (1527-1572) established the problematique for Korean thinkers for centuries. In particular, it centered Korean Neo-Confucian reflection on questions relating to the interface of metaphysics and psychological theory.  For T\'oegye and other self-cultivation oriented Neo-Confucians, this was a topic of intense concern: in the framework of Neo-Confucian thought, a proper, metaphysically grounded understanding of the structure and functioning of the psyche explains human perfection and imperfection; it is thus the foundation for any theory for the practice of spiritual cultivation.   (Adapted from article written for Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 1994 )Cosmology   Cosmology and metaphysics are presented most directly in the first chapter of To Become a Sage. T\'oegye chose for the first chapter of his Ten Diagrams the work that became the cornerstone of this area of Neo-Confucian thought, Chou Tun-i\'s Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate. The chapter includes both the diagram and Chou\'s own explanation of the diagram, along with further comments by Chu Hsi and by T\'oegye. The Commentary on the chapter expands this with discussion of basic aspects of the framework of this cosmological vision. Sections of the commentary include:       On On Beginning with the \"Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate\" The Relationship of Principle and Material Force                    Principle as the Ultimate of Non?Being and the Supreme Ultimate The Supreme Ultimate and Material Force                            The One and the Many.                                                  Neo-Confucianism has been described as an \"anthropo-cosmic\" vision. This means that fundamental elements of Neo-Confucian anthropology, including psychology, ethics, spiritual cultivation are grounded in the categories and structure of the cosmology. Thus the full meaning of the cosmology becomes clear only when all these other areas are considered as well. Psychology, dealing with the dynamic structure and function of the mind-and-heart, is a particularly critical juncture of the cosmic and human dimensions of this vision.

They are one and the same; without water, there is no life. A century ago, a dryland farmer on the Great Plains would have understood that analogy perfectly, it\'s truth would be evident and undeniable. Today, that connection is harder to see, development and modern technologies have clouded our ability to observe as carefully. However, the analogy is still just as true now as then; we, along with every other organism on earth, need clean, fresh water every day to sustain our existence and quality of life. What\'s more, clean water is scarce and becoming scarcer. Population growth and development often result in the contamination and pollution of our water supplies, which limits our water supply and decreases its water quality. Therefore, to maintain our current quality of life and to preserve the integrity of the ecosystem that we are a part of, we need to insure that we have adequate, high quality water supplies. The Challenges Despite the successes, there remain several areas where our paradigms and treatment technologies fail to protect or maintain desirable water quality. Most of the treatment technologies in use today would be recognizable by our grandparents, and yet the world has changed significantly, so \"doing things the way they have always been done\" is no longer an appropriate strategy. For example, many water quality issues in the United States today are related to non-point contaminant sources. In contrast to point sources, it is likely that current \"concrete box\" treatment technologies will not prove to be appropriate strategies for the control of diffuse contaminant sources. Therefore, we need to develop and optimize \"softer\" control strategies such as engineered treatment wetlands, riparian buffer strips, or aquifer recharge and recovery systems that protect water quality, recycle wastewater and stormwater, and provide habitat. Another important issue is the problem of bioactive contaminants and related sublethal effects in humans and aquatic organisms. By and large, we know how to control gross pollution problems that cause mortality or cancer in aquatic organisms. Recent discoveries indicate that sublethal effects may be equally important: What happens when we alter growth, survival, and reproduction in aquatic organisms (or even humans) without killing them outright or giving them cancer? Scientists have observed that anthropogenic contaminants cause drastic changes to growth, survival, fitness, and fecundity in affected organisms. Over time, these changes can even decrease the populations of aquatic organisms, we kill nothing outright, but our actions contribute to long slow slides toward extinction. How can we predict or control these problems? In my research group, I hope to find these answers. Graduate Student and Post-Doctoral Opportunities Here at UNR, I am always looking for well-qualified students with an interest in water quality. We have a small, but strong and growing, environmental engineering department here at UNR, and we collaborate with many highly respected programs at UNR, the Desert Research Institute, and many other research institutions in the U.S. I have numerous projects in various stages of development, so if you are interested in graduate education or career development at UNR, please send me a statement of interest, a CV, and an unofficial transcript. Reno, Nevada Most people think of Reno as an epicenter of gambling, picturesque lounge lizards, Burning Man, and competition bowling (think Kingpin). While it is some of that, most people don\'t realize that the Reno-Tahoe region is a pretty epic place to live if you like outdoor activities. You will have no problem banging out a few runs on the ski hill or down the whitewater course before work, working a full and productive day, and finishing your evening with a few pitches of rock climbing, or a few miles of fire trail on your mountain bike, or an hour or two of dry fly fishing to rising trout.

Life. They are one and the same; without water, there is no life. A century ago, a dryland farmer on the Great Plains would have understood that analogy perfectly, it\'s truth would be evident and undeniable. Today, that connection is harder to see, development and modern technologies have clouded our ability to observe as carefully. However, the analogy is still just as true now as then; we, along with every other organism on earth, need clean, fresh water every day to sustain our existence and quality of life. What\'s more, clean water is scarce and becoming scarcer. Population growth and development often result in the contamination and pollution of our water supplies, which limits our water supply and decreases its water quality. Therefore, to maintain our current quality of life and to preserve the integrity of the ecosystem that we are a part of, we need to insure that we have adequate, high quality water supplies. The Challenges Despite the successes, there remain several areas where our paradigms and treatment technologies fail to protect or maintain desirable water quality. Most of the treatment technologies in use today would be recognizable by our grandparents, and yet the world has changed significantly, so \"doing things the way they have always been done\" is no longer an appropriate strategy. For example, many water quality issues in the United States today are related to non-point contaminant sources. In contrast to point sources, it is likely that current \"concrete box\" treatment technologies will not prove to be appropriate strategies for the control of diffuse contaminant sources. Therefore, we need to develop and optimize \"softer\" control strategies such as engineered treatment wetlands, riparian buffer strips, or aquifer recharge and recovery systems that protect water quality, recycle wastewater and stormwater, and provide habitat. Another important issue is the problem of bioactive contaminants and related sublethal effects in humans and aquatic organisms. By and large, we know how to control gross pollution problems that cause mortality or cancer in aquatic organisms. Recent discoveries indicate that sublethal effects may be equally important: What happens when we alter growth, survival, and reproduction in aquatic organisms (or even humans) without killing them outright or giving them cancer? Scientists have observed that anthropogenic contaminants cause drastic changes to growth, survival, fitness, and fecundity in affected organisms. Over time, these changes can even decrease the populations of aquatic organisms, we kill nothing outright, but our actions contribute to long slow slides toward extinction. How can we predict or control these problems? In my research group, I hope to find these answers. Graduate Student and Post-Doctoral Opportunities Here at UNR, I am always looking for well-qualified students with an interest in water quality. We have a small, but strong and growing, environmental engineering department here at UNR, and we collaborate with many highly respected programs at UNR, the Desert Research Institute, and many other research institutions in the U.S. I have numerous projects in various stages of development, so if you are interested in graduate education or career development at UNR, please send me a statement of interest, a CV, and an unofficial transcript. Reno, Nevada Most people think of Reno as an epicenter of gambling, picturesque lounge lizards, Burning Man, and competition bowling (think Kingpin). While it is some of that, most people don\'t realize that the Reno-Tahoe region is a pretty epic place to live if you like outdoor activities. You will have no problem banging out a few runs on the ski hill or down the whitewater course before work, working a full and productive day, and finishing your evening with a few pitches of rock climbing, or a few miles of fire trail on your mountain bike, or an hour or two of dry fly fishing to rising trout. And that\'s just on your weekdays. All that and more, Reno has a strong university and is a great location for finding your life-work balance, take a look at it and explore around.

Kolodziej Assistant Professor Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Nevada, Reno office: 349B SEM phone: (775) 682-5553 email: koloj@unr.eduWebCampus Email Directory A-Z Index Edward Kolodziej, Ph.D. Home Research Publications Courses About Me Links In a nutshell: My research interests focus on providing clean, sustainable water for people and ecosystems. In more detail... Water Reuse, Reclamation, and Contaminants of Emerging Concern My research expertise is assessing the fate and transport of organic contaminants in the aquatic environment. Recent studies indicate that many surface waters, ground waters, and even drinking water supplies contain trace concentrations of numerous (many thousands!) organic contaminants. Why? The compounds we produce and use do not magically disappear when we are done with them, they will co-exist with us in our environment for days, months, years, and in some cases, even centuries. Did you know that many of the chemicals that you use will not only outlive you, but also your grandchildren, and in some cases, your grandchildren\'s grandchildren? True. These contaminants include detergents, personal care products like sunscreens and fragrances, pharmaceuticals such as antidepressants and antibiotics, brominated flame retardants, steroid hormones, pesticides, and many other problematic compounds. With growing public recognition that these \"contaminants of emerging concern\" are widespread in the environment, and even present in drinking water, there is increasing public pressure to control the introduction of these contaminants into the environment. Very few engineered treatment systems were designed to remove trace concentrations of organic contaminants. Therefore, few of our existing control measures will efficiently control the release of these contaminants of emerging concern, implying that current engineered treatment systems need upgrading to more efficient treatment systems if control of trace organics is a priority. This may be our generation\'s infrastructure challenge: upgrading wastewater treatment systems beyond nutrients and bulk organic carbon removal. In arid areas such as the Southwestern US, demographic shifts and increasing emigration have resulted in insufficient water supplies to meet current demand. To address this shortfall in water supply, large scale investment in water reuse and water reclamation systems is inevitable. However, the widespread observations of contaminants of emerging concern in receiving waters suggest that public acceptance of water reuse and reclamation is uncertain. Because most water reuse and reclamation systems recycle recalcitrant compounds along with water, it is likely that the problem of recalcitrant organic contaminants will be exacerbated by the growing use of these systems. Therefore, my interest in emerging contaminants and water reuse technologies focuses upon optimizing contaminant degradation in engineered water reuse systems. I am particularly interested in the optimization of in situ treatment technologies such as managed underground storage as sustainable, low energy, low infrastructure solutions to the problem of water reclamation. Occurrence, Fate, and Transport of Steroid Hormones Any concentration of vertebrates (e.g. humans, cattle, fish, birds) produces a local accumulation of endocrine active steroid hormones that can enter receiving waters and potentially affect aquatic organisms if not properly controlled. Sources of steroid hormones include municipal wastewater effluent and animal agricultural operations such as CAFOs or grazing livestock. These steroids include the endogenous steroids (steroids that are naturally produced) as well as exogenous compounds (man-made synthetics) such as pharmaceuticals and anabolic growth promoters such as trenbolone and melengestrol which are widely used in animal agriculture. In fact, most beef cattle in the U.S. are dosed with anabolic steroids to promote weight gain. So why do environmental steroid hormones matter? Well, if you are a fish living in a receiving water with elevated concentrations of steroid hormones (or other endocrine disrupting compounds), you might find that your endocrine system has been \"scrambled\" a bit due to those contaminants. Does this sound like a positive or desirable outcome? Adverse effects include feminization of male fish, the masculinization of female fish, intersex gondal tissue, and altered biochemistry and behavior along with many other effects. More importantly, endocrine active steroids can reduce fecundity, basically decreasing the number of viable eggs a female fish produces, at trace concentrations. These effects do not cause death or cancer, but instead alter the fitness, behavior, and most importantly, the reproductive potential of affected organisms. Over generations, populations of aquatic organisms exposed to endocrine disrupting contaminants are potentially smaller than populations of unexposed organisms due to reproductive disruption. Interestingly enough, this pattern of slow decline in population size despite no acute or chronic toxicity events is prevalent for many populations of aquatic organisms. Also, there are many studies using endocrine sensitive bioassays which demonstrate the widespread occurrence of endocrine activity in receiving waters, although the causative agents responsible for this endocrine activity are currently unknown. Could sublethal effects associated with endocrine disrupting contaminants like environmental steroids, or their transformation products, be responsible for these declines? I want to know. My interest in endocrine disruption focuses upon identifying sources of steroid hormones and other endocrine disruptors, identifying their major transport and transformation pathways in the environment, and determining their persistence and degradation in the natural and engineered environment. Once we understand the sources of these compounds and their fate in the environment, we can optimize our engineered systems to remove them and protect ecosystem health if this is necessary. Examples of optimizing engineered systems might include the quantification and manipulation of steroid hormone attenuation mechanisms in municipal wastewater treatment plants, engineered treatment wetlands, agricultural systems, bioretention basins, and riparian buffer strips. Agricultural Operations as Sources of Steroid Hormones Did you know that the vast majority of beef cattle raised in the United States are implanted with potent anabolic steroids to improve their weight gain? Where do these compounds go? Based on the existing literature, the fate of these compounds in the environment is unclear, we are currently only accounting for a small fraction of the mass of these compounds used in animal agriculture. Numerous studies have detected steroids at elevated concentrations in watersheds with agricultural operations such as confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) or livestock grazing, and although researchers do report associations between animal agriculture and endocrine activity, there really doesn\'t seem to be a \"smoking gun\" contaminant responsible for these effects. For many years now, researchers have investigated agricultural sources of steroids by examining a relatively limited number of analytes with available standards and a narrow focus on specific endocrine pathways. I would like to investigate this question more broadly, by investigating the potential for structural conservation and retained bioactivity through environmental transformations across multiple endocrine endpoints. If our small subset of known endocrine disrupting steroids cannot account for the observed endocrine activity in receiving waters, it may be possible that transformation products and other non-target metabolites of known endocrine disrupting steroids retain bioactivity and explain these observations. Analytically, while our detection methods are extremely sensitive, they are also incredibly specific, thus it is possible that we simply cannot \"see\" many of the closely related steroidal structures likely present in these environments. Hopefully, attenuation processes will adequately degrade these contaminants, reduce their bioactivity, and appropriate runoff management strategies will control the transport of these compounds, but whether these strategies truly minimize the risk to aquatic organisms is unknown. I simply do not believe that we understand these systems well enough yet, and we may be overlooking possible fate and transport outcomes. To assess the transport of synthetic steroid hormones on rangelands and to identify and quantify relevent degradation processes for synthetic steroid hormones, my laboratory, in conjunction with several other collaborators such as Dr. David Cwiertny (U. Iowa), Dr. Ken Tate (UC Davis), Dr. Chris Jeffrey (UNR), Dr. P. Lee Ferguson (Duke), Dr. Kris Wammer (U. St. Thomas), Dr. Adam Ward (U. Iowa) and Dr. Dan Schlenk (UC Riverside), is conducting several research studies on steroid fate, transformation, and transport. Disruption of Pheromonal Signaling and Olfactory Communication Over the last decade, the substantial body of research related to endocrine disruption has taught us one important lesson: Anthropogenic contaminants that interfere with biological signaling pathways related to reproduction can result in decreased population size and threaten ecological stability. Nearly all research on endocrine disruption has focused on disruption of mechanisms related to nuclear steroid hormone receptors. This mechanism of action is based upon contaminants partitioning from the surrounding water into the bloodstream of affected organisms, entering cell nuclei, binding to nuclear steroid receptors, and altering \"normal\" endocrine function, resulting in effects such as intersex or disrupted reproductive potential. Observations of nuclear receptor mediated endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms suggest that at least some species of fish in contaminated locations are experiencing the disruption of endocrine function solely through olfactory receptor mechanisms because humans are undoubtedly discharging contaminants that bind to or interfere with olfactory function. If waterborne contaminants bind to olfactory receptors (no partitioning into the body or blood borne transport is necessary), secondary messenger signaling that acts to alter endocrine status in affected organisms is likely to occur. For example, it is well known that progestin pheromones regulate gonadotropin hormone (GtH) levels in some species of fish during reproductive periods. The regulation of gonadotropin hormone, a potent hormone and regulator of endocrine status, results in substantial alterations to biochemistry and behavior in responsive fish. I think it\'s very likely that humans are discharging progestin steroids or progestin-mimicking compounds, along with many other olfactory-active compounds, into receiving waters, implying that humans may be inadvertently disrupting biochemistry and behavior in sensitive species of fish through olfactory mechanisms, with potential adverse effects on fish reproduction similar to those observed through nuclear receptor mechanisms. Potentially important olfactory disruptors include steroid hormones such as progestins, androstenedione, as well as compounds such as prostaglandins. Other contaminants such as metals and pesticides affect olfaction through physical damage of the olfactory bulb, removing the ability of affected organisms to respond to olfactory cues. As biologists and ecotoxicologists learn more about olfactory disruption and its effects, I expect that in some cases, efforts to insure the health of aquatic organisms would include an assessment of the potential for olfactory disruption in much the same way that the potential for endocrine disruption is assessed presently. Trace Contaminants Removal in Algal Bioreactors for Biofuels Production The available climate evidence seems to unequivocally suggest that we need to move beyond fossil carbon based energy production and we need to do so immediately. What will replace petroleum and coal based energy without adverse effects on the global economy? Algal biofuels are one potential element of the diverse and sustainable energy portfolio of the future, especially if the algae can be grown on low quality recycled carbon and nutrient sources such as treated municipal wastewater. This concept is the basis of the OMEGA biofuels system which utilizes conventionally treated municipal wastewater as the feedstock for algal bioreactors that also can produce biofuels. Working with Dr. Jonathan Trent (NASA), we are exploring the range of water quality improvements these algal bioreactors are capable of and the mechanisms responsible for contaminant reduction. Most studies to date suggest that algal biofuels production alone is not cost effective or energetically favorable. However, if the algal bioreactors also provide ancillary benefits such as wastewater treatment, these symbiotic systems may become economically viable options for fossil carbon replacement. Our goal is to evaluate this possibility, essentially by treating the algal bioreactors as a tertiary wastewater treatment system that incidentally produces carbon neutral biofuels. Sustainable treatment of municipal wastewater with algae is actually a very old concept, extensively investigated by another famous UC Berkeley researcher Dr. William Oswald as early as the 1950s. He may have been farther ahead of his time than he knew. Or maybe his work just proves the point that there are no new ideas, only ideas whose time has finally arrived.

Why Water Quality and Environmental Engineering? Fundamentally, I am a person who is passionate about the outdoors and the amazing environment we live in. We can\'t live without it, it is worth our care and protection, and I see environmental engineering both as necessary step on an inevitable path to societal and ecological sustainablity and a way to mimimize the ecological footprint that our human activities have on our surrounding environment. What I do for fun and because I like the stories.. Rock Climbing keeps me busy on my (rare) free time. Some favorite climbs and adventures: The Nose, Yosemite; Serenity Crack/Sons of Yesterday, Yosemite; American Wet Dream, Tuolumne Meadows; OZ, Tuolumne Meadows; Lucky Streaks, Tuolumne Meadows; Ygdrasil, Incredible Hulk; Grand Wall, Stawamus Chief; Fine Jade, The Rectory; Lightning Bolt Cracks, North Six Shooter; Petit Grepon, RMNP; Pingora, Wind Rivers; Direct Exum, Grand Tetons; Picture Peak, Sierras; What\'s My Line, Cochise Stronghold; Absinthe of Mallet, Cochise Stronghold; Black Elk, Wind Rivers. Fly Fishing on the Truckee during an evening hatch is hard to beat.. Favorite Rivers: Truckee (my home water these days, 2 minutes from my house) and the overused, but still great, Little Truckee; Yuba; McCloud; Smith; Deschutes; Upper Connecticut; Penobscot; and a variety of other special places that exact their toll in sweat and blood on the approach. Surfing when I can get to the coast. Favorite Surf Breaks: Ocean Beach; SF; Waddell Coast, Santa Cruz; Pleasure Point, Santa Cruz; Nexpa, Mexico; Cathedral Rock, AUS; Saltwater Creek, AUS; and the sand point break at Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. Backcountry Skiing during the winter is one way to get to some beautiful places in Tahoe. I like lots of runs on Tamarack Peak, Maggie\'s Peaks, and the nice little run out behind my house.             Education YEAR DEGREE UNIVERSITY MORE INFO 2004 Ph.D. UC Berkeley Dissertation topic: The Occurrence and Environmental Fate of Steroid Hormones with Endocrine and Pheromonal Activity in Fish. 1999 M.S.

Our study begins in 753 BC and will ultimately extend to the present day. Aquae Urbis Romae examines the intersections between natural hydrological elements including springs, rain, streams, marshes, and the Tiber River, and constructed hydraulic elements including aqueducts, fountains, sewers, bridges, conduits, etc., that together create the water infrastructure system of Rome. The long term goals of this project are to increase understanding of the profound relationships that exist between water systems, cultural practice, and urbanism in Rome, and by its example, in all cities, landscapes, and environments. It is hoped that this study will foster work by other scholars and designers who are interested in exploring the ways in which water infrastructure can be exploited toward the future development of humane, ecologically responsible, and engaging civic environments. This is expecially critical as our world faces both critical water shortages and rising sea levels due to climate change. ENTER THE G.I.S. TIMELINE This project is made possible in part by funding from The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, The Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology, The National Endowment for the Humanities, The Fulbright Commission, The Prince Charitable Trusts, The John Anson Kittredge Educational Trust, and the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts.

An interdisciplinary organization, SHOT is concerned not only with the history of technological devices and processes but also with technology in history—that is, the relationship of technology to politics, economics, science, the arts, and the organization of production, and with the role it plays in the differentiation of individuals in society. Not least, it is concerned with interpretive flexibility, the conception that beliefs about whether a technology \"works\" are contingent on the expectations, needs, and ideologies of those who interact with it. SHOT members represent a wide range of disciplines and professions, from history and the humanities to engineering and science, and come from some thirty-five countries throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa.

Above, you will find links to a three-week unit culminating in a podcast project. Sample themes are provided as well as materials including a reading text and sample student writing and podcast. Instructions on how to produce a podcast with Garage Band, Audacity and Audioboo are also on this website. The students will first read a short text and then produce their own piece of writing. After that, they will peer edit as well as meet with you individually to improve their writing before transforming it into a podcast. The students will edit their podcasts and add sound effects, music, and pictures. This works great with heterogeneous classes because of the individualized attention the students receive. And because they are able to work at his or her own pace. Detailed lesson objectives are the section titled Timeline. Podcasts are a great tool for several reasons. They are easy to put together using a computer or mobile device. It offers ELLs who tend to be nervous speaking in front of class an alternative presentation method. And because they will be publishing the podcast on the web, their families who may be abroad will be able to view the story and share in their educational experience. Overall, this unit allows the students to practice reading, writing, listening, and speaking. It can be repeated during the school year using other themes. I’ve used podcasts in my ESOL classroom with secondary students and they have really enjoyed them.

The tale of the ugly duckling has since taken an extraordinary global journey and become the most successful telenovela to date. This groundbreaking book asks what the Yo soy Betty,la fea/Ugly Betty phenomenon can tell us about the international circulation of locally produced TV fictions as the Latin American telenovela is sold to,and/or re-made-officially and unofficially-for different national contexts. The contributors explore what Betty has to say about the tensions between the commercial demands of multimedia conglomerates and the regulatory forces of national broadcasters as well as the international ambitions of national TV industries and their struggle in competitive markets. They also investigate what this international trade tells us about cultural storytelling and audience experience,as well as ideologies of feminine beauty and myths of female desire and aspiration.

The tale of the ugly duckling has since taken an extraordinary global journey and become the most successful telenovela to date. This groundbreaking book asks what the Yo soy Betty,la fea/Ugly Betty phenomenon can tell us about the international circulation of locally produced TV fictions as the Latin American telenovela is sold to,and/or re-made-officially and unofficially-for different national contexts. The contributors explore what Betty has to say about the tensions between the commercial demands of multimedia conglomerates and the regulatory forces of national broadcasters as well as the international ambitions of national TV industries and their struggle in competitive markets. They also investigate what this international trade tells us about cultural storytelling and audience experience,as well as ideologies of feminine beauty and myths of female desire and aspiration.

The themes examined include religion, caste, language, and gender in online communities and call centers, and the roles of these factors in the global economy, Bollywood online and offline, digital music, websites for arranging marriages, and so on. The book attempts to map «South Asia» in relation to global technospaces produced through and as a consequence of economic globalization efforts.

Reviews «This collection provides an important contribution to the emerging field of cyberculture studies. By assembling essays that consider technology from a variety of angles, the editors reveal the blind spots of new media theories, postcolonial theory, and diaspora studies. The volume elucidates the remarkable woof and warp of labor, education, and communication strategies, using South Asia as place to complicate prevailing assumptions concerning globalized cyberspace and the advent of worldwide participation in digital technologies.» (from the preface by Jillana Enteen, Northwestern University) Series Digital Formations.

Grounded in an understanding of the ongoing evolution in computer and internet technology and in the ways in which girls themselves use that technology, the book privileges studies of girls as active producers of computer/Internet content, and incorporates an international/intercultural perspective so as to extend our understanding of girls, the Internet, and the negotiation of identity.

Mazzarella (Ph.D., University of Illinois) is Professor and Director of the School of Communication Studies at James Madison University. Her research interests are in girls’ studies and the representational politics of mediated portrayals of youth. She is editor of 20 Questions about Youth and the Media (Peter Lang, 2007), Girl Wide Web: Girls, the Internet, and the Negotiation of Identity (Peter Lang, 2005), and co-editor of Growing Up Girls: Popular Culture and the Construction of Identity (Peter Lang, 1999). Reviews «The global complexities of girlhood, new media, and identities are highlighted in this cutting-edge anthology. Girlhood is broadly defined, encompassing a range of ages as well as social locations across class, nation, race, ethnicity, and sexuality; the authors are acutely aware of the ways in which power and politics circumscribe the new media environment, addressing the impacts on girls’ lives of the digital divide, poverty, gender violence, transnational marketing and consumerism, and cultural forces. At the same time, girls’ self-definition, agency, and resistance shines through in these essays, as girls tap into the power of the Web and use it to articulate their diverse experiences and stances. This is an important and exciting follow-up to the first Girl Wide Web anthology, expanding the scope and substance of contemporary girl studies.» (Meenakshi Gigi Durham, Associate Professor, University of Iowa, author of ‘The Lolita Effect’) «This compelling sequel to Girl Wide Web expands and enriches our understanding of both girlhood and the Internet during the Web’s second generation. Validating girls’ media practices around the globe while also complicating notions of agency, literacy, community, and civic engagement via attention to difference, the contributors and their research subjects demonstrate the complex interactions, negotiations, and performances of girls’ participatory cyberculture.» (Mary Celeste Kearney, author of ‘Girls Make Media’) Series Mediated Youth.

Books ? Courses Mediated Identities: Youth, Agency and Globalization 2009, Peter Lang Publishing Mediated Identities is an empirical examination of how youth identity is negotiated in urban and rural spaces where cultural, economic, and political forces compete for the allegiance of the young consumer and worker. Rich with fieldwork on teens and television in India, Germany, South Africa, and the United States, the book provides a new direction for the critical discussion of youth agency. It questions young people as autonomous consumers and examines the interpellatory forces of media and market. The application of postcolonial theory produces an incisive analysis of television and other media consumption as part of a process that bolsters the neocolonial imperatives of globalization. Simultaneously, the book focuses on the opportunism on both sides of the equation, on youth particularly in developing economies and the industries that need their cheap labor. In such opportunistic contexts, Mediated Identities addresses ethical dilemmas and transformative possibilities.

Linked by a shared history of colonialism, state socialism, large diasporas, and recent market liberalization, India and China are poised to become twenty-first-century world powers. While both enjoy a rich ensemble of religious iconography, legends, and folk traditions, Indian and Chinese producers and consumers are today challenged to find modes of expression that are culturally authentic and commercially viable in an increasingly globalized media environment. Essays cover topics such as the influence of transnational Indian families on the narrative elements of Bollywood productions, the rise of made-in-China blockbusters, the development of pan-Asian cinema, and migrants\' use of the Internet to maintain connections with their homelands.

She is the author of Cultures in Orbit: Satellite Technologies and Visual Media. All books by Lisa Parks Shanti Kumar is Assistant Professor of Media and Cultural Studies in the Department of Communication Arts at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. All books by Shanti Kumar From the 1967 live satellite program \"Our World\" to MTV music videos in Indonesia, from French television in Senegal to the global syndication of African American sitcoms, and from representations of terrorism on German television to the international Teletubbies phenomenon, TV lies at the nexus of globalization and transnational culture. Planet TV provides an overview of the rapidly changing landscape of global television, combining previously published essays by pioneers of the study of television with new work by cutting-edge television scholars who refine and extend intellectual debates in the field. Organized thematically, the volume explores such issues as cultural imperialism, nationalism, postcolonialism, transnationalism, ethnicity and cultural hybridity. These themes are illuminated by concrete examples and case studies derived from empirical work on global television industries, programs, and audiences in diverse social, historical, and cultural contexts. Developing a new critical framework for exploring the political, economic, sociological and technological dimensions of television cultures, and countering the assumption that global television is merely a result of the current dominance of the West in world affairs, Planet TV demonstrates that the global dimensions of television were imagined into existence very early on in its contentious history. Parks and Kumar have assembled the critical moments in television\'s past in order to understand its present and future. Contributors include Ien Ang, Arjun Appadurai, Jose B. Capino, Michael Curtin, Jo Ellen Fair, John Fiske, Faye Ginsburg, R. Harindranath, Timothy Havens, Edward S. Herman, Michele Hilmes, Olaf Hoerschelmann, Shanti Kumar, Moya Luckett, Robert McChesney, Divya C. McMillin, Nicholas Mirzoeff, David Morley, Hamid Naficy, Lisa Parks, James Schwoch, John Sinclair, R. Anderson Sutton, Serra Tinic, John Tomlinson, and Mimi White. Reviews \"Everybody knows that TV is crucial to globalization. Now, thanks to Lisa Parks and Shanti Kumar, we know why and how television matters globally. With TV studies moving out of the classroom and onto the world stage, this volume will be an indispensable passport.\" —Toby Miller eBooks New York University Press is proud to make many of our titles available in eBook editions.

The main feature of the model is that it deals very explicitly with the physics of extracting energy from a fixed, finite reserve of fuel and the increasing energy cost of doing so. The EROEI associated with oil production has been in steady decline for the past one hundred years due to the increasing costs associated with finding and pumping more oil from exotic (e.g. continental shelves) locations. Far more energy is used up producing the infrastructure for obtaining this harder to reach oil. Today, for every BTU of oil that is obtained from these locations, we use up 1/20th of a BTU of previously pumped oil. Oil pumped from shallow wells in Pennsylvania or West Texas, nearly 100 years ago only required about 1/100th of a BTU for each BTU we obtained. Systems Science Systems science is the collection of highly interrelated subjects that taken together form a kind of meta-science, or a general science of science! Systems science includes subjects such as cybernetics, information theory, complexity theory, the universal theory of evolution (including sub-topics like emergence), network theory, and many more. What is unique about systems science is that its concepts broadly apply to every other science discipline. Indeed, many of the traditional disciplines have developed sub-branches named \"systems ...\", where the ellipsis can be filled in with names like \'biology\', \'sociology\', \'psychology\', \'ecology\', etc. I am currently co-authoring an introductory book on Systems Science to be published by Springer sometime next year. Evolutionary, Cognitive Neuro-Psychology Over the last few years I have rekindled one of my first loves in science — neurobiology — to explore the nature of real intelligence. This follows naturally from my work on autonomous agents (below) but has led me into a rather interesting realm that would not be obvious to those who have come to cognitive science strictly from the field of artificial intelligence. The Search for Sapience — The Cognitive Basis of Wisdom Many disciplines are converging on the workings of the human mind. From psychology we continue to refine probes of behavior and decision making/problem solving. From neurobiology, especially with the advent of dynamic imaging techniques, we have begun to map control functions to specific areas of the brain. And from Evo-Devo (evolution and development taken together) we are beginning to understand how the modern human brain came into existence and how it helped Homo sapiens emerge as the dominant hominid as well as a symbol manipulating (language and signs) sentience. These are extraordinarily exciting times in brain research. Neurobiologists are determining the capabilities of the prefrontal cortex in its role of providing so-called executive functions in guiding the reasoning and problem solving abilities of the mind. Recently attention has turned to the prefrontal cortex, particularly the extreme pole patch of tissue (right behind the eyes!) in processing judgment. My interest is in determining if this processing, which I have labeled sapience in order to distinguish the cognitive aspect from the performance and knowledge-base aspects of wisdom, is, indeed, the basis of what we recognize as wisdom. Real-time, on-line, life-time learning algorithms. This work has led to the development of a learning algorithm that provides a solution to the destructive interference problem in life-long learning systems. A patent for the Adaptrode mechanism has been issued. The work was funded, in part, by Caterpillar, Inc. and the patent is held jointly with that company. Autonomous agents in dynamic, nonstationary environments. I have been investigating the application of the above learning algorithm to improve the search performance of agents in highly dynamic and indeterminate environments. The research program is investigating how agents can encode causal relations between object cues and sought resources so that the cues can act as heuristic guides in future searches. Both physical and software agents have been the subject of investigations. This work has been funded, in part, by grants from Caterpillar, IBM and Ark Interfaces, a subsidiary of Packard-Bell NEC. A grant from the National Science Foundation is being used to extend the work using a robot platform.

Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. While the concepts and components of systems science will continue to be distributed throughout the various disciplines, undergraduate degree programs in systems science are also being developed, including at the authors? own institutions. However, the subject is approached, systems science as a basis for understanding the components and drivers of phenomena at all scales should be viewed with the same importance as a traditional liberal arts education.

Introduction: In this chapter I explore why intelligence and creativity, normally associated with wisdom, are not sufficient for the purposes of scientific study. I further propose to provide a general concept of sapience that allows us to consider directly and from the very outset a conceptual framework that integrates brain science and psychology. Such a framework, I assert, is more likely to yield testable hypotheses that will tie brain function and behavior together more appropriately. Today many neuropsychologists are tackling explanations of what part(s) of the brain are involved in what basic behavioral productions, and this has thus far proved fruitful. We should tackle sapience in the same way. Here I outline a few elements of this framework to show a way toward what might be possible. First, we need to situate sapience within the general framework of the mind, both our subjective experiences and what can be objectively determined. Second, we need to see if we can tease out some functional components of sapience that might allow us to use traditional analytical methods to identify processes more finely. Of course this cannot be a goal unto itself. It can only be meaningful in the context of a more holistic concept of sapience. Third, we need to consider the evolutionary history of sapience since its capacity uniquely defines our species. Sapience and second order consciousness [i.e., consciousness of being conscious, a property unique to humans, as far as we know (Donald 1991, 9)] will be found to go hand-inhand in an evolutionary sense.

Conf. on Computing Anticipatory Systems, CASYS\'01, Liege, Belgium, Aug. 2001. HTML version [200+k - with graphics] Abstract: MAVRIC II is a mobile, autonomous robot whose brain is comprised almost entirely of artificial adaptrode-based neurons. The architecture of this brain is based on the Extended Braitenberg Architecture (EBA) and includes the anticipatory computing capabilities of the adaptrode synapse. We are still in the process of collecting hard data on the behavioral traits of MAVRIC in the generalized foraging search task. But even now sufficient qualitative aspects of MAVRIC?s behavior have been garnered from foraging experiments to lend strong support to the theory that MAVRIC is a highly adaptive, life-like agent. The development of the current MAVRIC brain has led to some important insights into the nature of intelligent control. Based on the nervous system of a simple invertebrate creature, this brain and its interactions with a realistic environment, never-the-less, have led to some important qualitative principles of design. In this paper, we elucidate some of these principles and using this basis along with the work of Antonio Damasio, we develop concepts for the next generation (NG) brain. While it is a giant leap from the brain of a simple invertebrate to that of a human (as described by Damasio), the NG brain includes provisions for a proto-self reflecting the fundamental biological aspects of brain architecture as described by Damasio. We have reasons to believe that this proto-self is necessary for more advanced forms of intelligence. As with the success of the current brain, the NG brain will depend, ultimately, on the adaptive capacity (in a nonstationary world) of anticipatory processing elements.

HTML version [200+k - with graphics] Abstract: Biological inspiration admits to degrees. This paper describes a new neural processing algorithm inspired by a deeper understanding of the workings of real biological synapses. It is shown that a multi-time domain adaptation approach to encoding causal correlation solves the destructive interference problem encountered by more commonly used learning algorithms. It is also shown how this allows an agent to adapt to nonstationary environments in which longer-term changes in the statistical properties occur and are inherently unpredictable, yet not completely lose useful prior knowledge. Finally, it is suggested that the use of causal correlation coupled with value-based learning may provide pragmatic solutions to some other classical problems in machine learning.

HTML version [128k - with graphics] Abstract: We think because we eat. Or as Descartes might have said, on a little more reflection, \"I need to eat, therefore I think.\" Animals that forage for a living repeatedly face the problem of searching for a sparsely distributed resource in a vast space. Furthermore, the resource may occur sporadically and episodically under conditions of true uncertainty (non-stationary, complex and non-linear dynamics). I assert that this problem is the canonical problem solved by intelligence. It\'s solution is the basis for the evolution of more advanced intelligence in which the space of search includes that of concepts (objects and relations) encoded in cortical structures. In humans the conscious experience of searching through concept space we call thinking. The foraging search model is based upon a higher-order autopoeitic system (the forager) employing anticipatory processing to enhance its success at finding food while avoiding becoming food or having accidents in a hostile world. Aforager is an anticipatory system as defined by Rosen. I present a semi-formal description of the general foraging search problem and an approach to its solution. The latter is a brain-like structure employing dynamically adaptive neurons. A physical robot, MAVRIC, embodies some principles of foraging. It learns cues that lead to improvements in finding targets in a dynamic and non-stationary environment. This capability is based on a unique learning mechanism that encodes causal relations in the neural-like processing element. An argument is advanced that searching for resources in the physical world, as per the foraging model, is a prototype for generalized search for conceptual resources as when we think. A problem represents a conceptual disturbance in a homeostatic sense. The finding of a solution restores the homeostatic balance. The establishment of links between conceptual cues and solutions (resources) and the later use of those cues to think through to solutions of quasi-isomorphic problems is, essentially, foraging for ideas. It is a quite natural extension of the fundamental foraging model.

PDF File Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous robotic control may be applied to the problem of designing intelligent, mobile agents for cyberspace. This paper examines the field of behavior-based reactive systems (BBRS) as used in robotics that may be applicable in constructing intelligent agents. The problem of search in an unstructured and dynamic, distributed environment has been explored in a physical robot. Two major aspects — the use of chaos to generate stochastic path selection, and a unique associative learning mechanism that bounds the search space on subsequent runs — have been shown to be an efficient strategy for the robot in exploring a nonstationary environment. The role of chaos is to produce novel, yet constrained paths. The robot learns from experience that certain associations will increase its chances of finding mission-critical events, while others will inhibit it. On subsequent forays into the environment, the robot uses this knowledge to improve its discovery process. This paper describes the application of these mechanisms to an intelligent agent in search of information resources in a distributed, dynamic, and unstructured computer environment. We present a search for keywords, where the agent learns the node/directory/filename cues that will increase its chances of finding documents containing those keywords.

HTML version [412k including graphics] Introduction: We perceive the world to operate according to a fundamental principle of causality in spite of the seeming chaotic behavior of nature. The Universe seems to be orderly and we are able to comprehend this order at some very deep level. Some events (states of processes) cause other events, which, in turn, cause still other events. And we find, generally, that certain events tend to be associated with certain other events, which is to say, there is regularity to the Universe. This principle lies at the root of cognition and is the basis for scientific investigation. It can be viewed as the language of nature.

Available in HTML version [203k including graphics] Abstract: MAVRIC (Mobile Autonomous Vehicle for Research in Intelligent Control) is an embodied Braitenberg vehicle that is situated in a nonstationary, dynamic environment. It is controlled fully by an artificial brain comprised solely of simulated Adaptrode-based neurons. It learns to associate various environmental cues with mission-supportive or mission-threatening factors. It can then use those cues to seek or avoid objects. MAVRIC has roughly the intelligence of a moronic snail, but it has already yielded some insights into how greater intelligence might be built on top of lesser intelligent systems, thus recapitulating the evolution of intelligence in nature.

Available in HTML version [221k including graphics] Abstract: Many animal species are faced with the problem of finding sparsely distributed resources that occur (and disappear) dynamically in a huge space. Furthermore the dynamics of these resources are stochastic and probably chaotic in terms of both spatial and temporal distribution. But they are not completely random. The search strategy is called foraging. It involves two interrelated phases which dominate the behavior of the animal based on the amount of knowledge it has regarding the location and timing of the resource. In the absence of knowledge or cues foraging animals adopt a stochastic search pattern that will have a reasonably high likelihood of bringing them into encounters with the resource. With knowledge or cues, the animal switches to a more directed search behavior. Autonomous agents such as mobile robots may need to have these capabilities in order to find mission-critical objects yet no current algorithmic or heuristic search method adequately addresses this problem. The serendipitous discovery of a quasi-chaotic oscillating neural circuit used to generate motor signals in a mobile robot has led to the development of an autonomous agent search method that resembles foraging search in a number of details. An oscillator circuit, based on the concept of a central pattern generator (CPG) in biology, is described qualitatively. Its role in controlling the motion of a mobile robot and the effects it has on search efficiency are presented. Constraining search to potentially fruitful paths before any useful heuristics are available to the searcher is a problem of general interest in artificial intelligence. Foraging search based on chaotic oscillators may prove useful in a more general way.

Mobus Energy Research Area: Understanding the impacts of the global peak of oil production on other energy sources and the dynamics of the energy return on energy invested to extract it from different sources (e.g. fossil fuels, nuclear, and solar). What are the dynamics of an economic system as constraints on energy flows tighten? Associate Professor UW Tacoma Institute of Technology gmobus@u.washington.edu +1-253-692-5894 George Mobus faculty web page George Mobus\' Research Interests My research involves the development of a computer model of something I call an abstract economy. The main feature of the model is that it deals very explicitly with the physics of extracting energy from a fixed, finite reserve of fuel and the increasing energy cost of doing so. The energy return on energy invested (EROEI) associated with oil production has been in steady decline for the past 100 years due to the increasing costs associated with finding and pumping more oil from exotic locations (e.g. continental shelves). Far more energy is used up producing the infrastructure for obtaining this harder to reach oil. Today, for every BTU of oil that is obtained from these locations, we use up 1/20th of a BTU of previously pumped oil (or equivalent from other energy sources). Oil pumped from shallow wells in Pennsylvania or West Texas, nearly 100 years ago only required about 1/100th of a BTU for each BTU we obtained. The increase in difficulty in finding and extracting oil along with the declining EROEI is causing a decline in the extraction and refining rates. The dynamics suggest that we are near or at the peaking of global oil extraction. This leads to questions regarding energy’s role in economic activities. The research area looking at the role and dynamics of energy flow in the economy is called Biophysical Economics. A graph showing the rise and peaking of gross energy from a fixed, finite source (e.g. oil), the increasing cost (in energy units) of extraction per unit of energy extracted, and the rise and peaking of net energy gained and supplied to the economy Record last updated on November 28th 2011 PST.

Adaptive behavior is the hallmark of intelligence in nature.          Animals, in their natural environment, are faced with a dynamic, uncertain world.  It is one that is characterized by changes in the relationships between objects, not just the motion of objects. Such relationships may change over long or short time intervals (multiple time scales). In general, the world is nonstationary, meaning that it is impossible, even in principle, to predict the kinds of changes that will affect the future success of an agent.      The Adaptive Agents Laboratory is devoted to the study of intelligent behavior in nonstationary environments. The objective is to emulate the abilities of simple animals to adapt to changes in order to better understand the problems associated with succeeding in the face of an uncertain world. This approach is based on the notion of biomimetics - the attempt to mimic biological function in machines. We are interested in the degree to which it is necessary to emulate biological form in order to obtain biomimic function.      Please feel welcome to visit our site and see what we have been doing along these lines.    Home Visit Prices/Tickets/Hours Parking/Transportation Mercer Slough Calendar Of Events Accessibility & Services Group Sales Café/Catering Online Store IMAX/Theaters/Shows IMAX® Theaters Laser Dome Planetarium Live Science Stage Exhibits Current/Upcoming Exhibits Tropical Butterfly House Wellbody Academy Sonic Bloom Naked Mole Rat Cam Tinker Tank Portal To Current Research Exhibit Sales/Rentals PacSci360 Moviebooth Education/Programs Youth/Family Parents\' Night Out Camps Research Weekends Scientist Spotlight Teen Programs Preschools Adults Science Café 21+ Events Environmental Mercer Slough Around The Americas Carbon Monitoring Schools/Educators Field Trips Science On Wheels Education Resources Teacher Education/LASER Scientists Portal To The Public Science Comm.

My presentation on Biophysical Economics at the, Pacific Science Center, Science Café in Tacoma Multi-disciplinary Research Areas Though my day job remains working in Computer Science (esp. teaching CS courses), my range of interests in research topics is quite broad. Though it is not immediately obvious from the topic names (below), there is actually a thread of continuity that weaves among these areas. I am currently engaged in active research in several of these, with semi-active projects in the background in the others. Starting with the currently most active: Biophysical Economics and Energy Systems Systems Science and Energy Systems science is the collection of highly interrelated subjects that taken together form a kind of meta-science, or a general science of science! Systems science includes subjects such as cybernetics, information theory, complexity theory, the universal theory of evolution (including sub-topics like emergence), network theory, and many more. What is unique about systems science is that its concepts broadly apply to every other science discipline. Indeed, many of the traditional disciplines have developed sub-branches named \"systems ...\", where the ellipsis can be filled in with names like \'biology\', \'sociology\', \'psychology\', \'ecology\', etc. My textbook, with co-author Michael Kalton, Principles of Systems Science, Springer (Nov. 2014), has just been published and will be shipped in November, 2014. This book is an integration of the major various aspects of systems science and serves as a general introduction to the field as a whole, but also to those different sub-fields. Presently, I have been deeply involved in the application of systems science to energy systems in particular. This ranges from building a computer model of alternative energy sustainability to working on the development of a new modeling language that makes it easier to express energy and material flows in dynamic systems (see below). This last fall quarter I took my sabbatical at SUNY-ESF (State University of New York, Environmental Sciences and Forestry) in Syracuse, NY, working with a group of scientists led by Professor Charles Hall who have developed the extremely important concept of energy return on energy investment (EROEI). Hall and several others, coming from fields as diverse as systems ecology and business management have begun to develop a whole new way to study economic phenomena. It builds upon the early work in Ecological Economics, which attempts to embed the more reliable aspects of economics theories within the framework of whole systems ecology. The new approach is called Biophysical Economics. Biophysical Economics Ecological economics does attend to energy matters in economics, but not as a main feature. Biophysical economics puts much more focus on energy and its flow through economic systems to better understand the nature of wealth production, growth, and resource depletion. Energy is an extremely important aspect because, for the modern industrial economies, over 80% of our energy comes from fossil fuels, and in the case of oil, the \"king pin\" energy, we have reached the peak of global production. The consequences of this phenomenon are just now beginning to be understood from a scientific perspective. My research in this arena involves the development of a biophysical model of something I call an abstract economy. The main feature of the model is that it deals very explicitly with the physics of extracting energy from a fixed, finite reserve of fuel and the increasing energy cost of doing so. The EROEI associated with oil production has been in steady decline for the past one hundred years due to the increasing costs associated with finding and pumping more oil from exotic (e.g. continental shelves) locations. Far more energy is used up producing the infrastructure for obtaining this harder to reach oil. Today, for every BTU of oil that is obtained from these locations, we use up 1/20th of a BTU of previously pumped oil. Oil pumped from shallow wells in Pennsylvania or West Texas, nearly 100 years ago only required about 1/100th of a BTU for each BTU we obtained. To date my model has made it clear that the net energy flow (the gross energy less the energy cost), which is the energy that is used in the rest of the economy, has been in decline for the past thirty years or so. From this it is not hard to link this decline in net energy with many of the economic phenomena that have been plaguing our world over that time. We even have a way of explaining globalization as a response to declining net energy! Several papers are in process which will explicate these phenomena. Evolutionary, Cognitive Neuro-Psychology Over the last few years I have rekindled one of my first loves in science — neurobiology — to explore the nature of real intelligence. This follows naturally from my work on autonomous agents (below) but has led me into a rather interesting realm that would not be obvious to those who have come to cognitive science strictly from the field of artificial intelligence. The Search for Sapience — The Cognitive Basis of Wisdom When one looks at the situation with energy and other global problems that seem to be coming to a head in recent times, one has to ask: \"If humans are so clever, why have they failed to act in such a way that ensures a sustainable future?\" Why, in other words, are humans generally so foolish? The advances in understanding how the brain works have literally exploded over the last several decades, and particularly in the first decade of the 21st century. Many disciplines are converging on the workings of the human mind. From psychology we continue to refine probes of behavior and decision making/problem solving. From neurobiology, especially with the advent of dynamic imaging techniques, we have begun to map control functions to specific areas of the brain. And from Evo-Devo (evolution and development taken together) we are beginning to understand how the modern human brain came into existence and how it helped Homo sapiens emerge as the dominant hominid as well as a symbol manipulating (language and signs) sentience. These are extraordinarily exciting times in brain research. But a major puzzle has developed as we understand intelligence, creativity, and affect (emotions and feelings) in their evolutionary and contemporary contexts. Humans, even the most intelligent ones, often fail to make good judgments. Age helps, but is no guarantee that people will make wise choices. Many psychologists have begun to explore the psychological basis of wisdom and have defined a recognizable construct which they can probe with tests similar to those used to probe intelligences. It is now reasonably clear that wisdom is related to intelligence, but is not just more intelligence. It involves reflective judgment and a wealth of tacit life-knowledge. Wise people make choices of what to turn their intelligence and creativity to, of what to learn and what knowledge is useful in solving complex life and social problems. Wisdom involves superior moral judgments that benefit the largest numbers for the longest times. At the same time neurobiologists are determining the capabilities of the prefrontal cortex in its role of providing so-called executive functions in guiding the reasoning and problem solving abilities of the mind. Recently attention has turned to the prefrontal cortex, particularly the extreme pole patch of tissue (right behind the eyes!) in processing judgment. My interest is in determining if this processing, which I have labeled sapience in order to distinguish the cognitive aspect from the performance and knowledge-base aspects of wisdom, is, indeed, the basis of what we recognize as wisdom. A major question, from an evolutionary perspective, is this: If the human brain has evolved a higher form of judgment, geared presumably to the life problems faced by early Holocene hominids, is that capability sufficient to guide us in our present circumstances? This is a sociological question as much as an evolutionary or psychological one. Is modern Homo sapiens wise enough to make good choices on global and multi-generational scales? Recent political events across the world, overpopulation and over-consumption of non-renewable resources, which seem to reflect that we, as a species, have not learned much from history, would suggest that the answer to that question is no. This research, which is both personal and academic, is integrative and geared to finding an answer to that question. Given the rate at which we, as a species, seem to be degrading our life-support systems, it might be good to know if we even have the mental capacity to solve the problems we\'ve created. Here is a partial bibliography of books that I have found particularly interesting in this quest. And here is a bibliography of books on global issues that support the suggestion that we humans are not very wise as a species. Computational Projects My interest in the above research area, especially in light of the various global issues that face humanity, has motivated me to apply my computer science background to projects that just might contribute to the analysis and solving of some of these problems. I have started two projects that are directed at producing tools for analyzing complex systems problems, both technical and social. One project involves the development of a new systems dynamics modeling language to aid researchers in studying highly complex, hierarchically structured dynamic systems. The other project involves developing a global-scale, structured, e-discourse platform that will allow participants from all over the globe to help in the top-down analysis and bottom-up design of complex social problems (so-called \"wicked\" problems). The Computing & Software Systems program at UWT has a Master\'s of Science degree program. I invite anyone who wants to further their education in computing and has a bent on helping to save the world(!) to contact me regarding these two projects. Dynamic Systems Modeling Language - DynSysMod DynSysMod is a new modeling language for expressing discrete time models of a wide variety of concrete systems. If you are familiar with languages such as DYNAMO or STELLA you may appreciate the benefits that DynSysMod should provide. For starters we have explicitly identified three different types of flows — matter, energy, and messages. This makes it easier to create models of systems that have large inputs of free energy to drive production processes. After several years of trying to delineate these separate flows in STELLA and ending up with incredibly complex models that were difficult to interpret it became apparent that real systems would be better represented if the flows were segregated. Another innovation planed for DynSysMod is to provide a method for representing models in hierarchical decomposition or upward composition. In other words one can start defining a model from a very high level macro-view and then decompose the system into its component subsystems. Alternatively one can define a system that can later be combined with another system operating in the same time domain. In part this will be achieved by allowing different levels in the hierarchy to operate with different time step increments. For example a shop floor might be updated on an hourly basis while the inventories could be updated on a daily basis. We are currently exploring the computational efficiencies that might be gained by taking this approach as opposed to updating an entire model by just the smallest time increment of any of its components. DynSysMod is being developed primarily to allow those interested in energy systems to test various aspects of, say, an alternative energy system such as solar photovoltaics or wind. I began this project in response to the difficulties I encountered in modelling what I call the Energy Systems Sustainability Criterion. This criterion is relatively simple to understand but fiendishly difficult to get ahold of in practice. It says that any energy conversion capital equipment (such as solar panels or wind turbines) must, in the long run, produce enough excess energy above that consumed in the economy, to maintain and replace itself when its useful life is over. At first glance this might seem like a simple thing to verify, but it has second and higher order aspects, such as there must be enough energy to account for the fraction of energy used to maintain and build the manufacturing plant where the capital equipment is produced (as well as cover other work-costs). A modelling language that breaks out the explicit flows and reservoirs of energy, as well as captures the first and second laws of thermodynamics, should be very helpful in determining how energy flows through such a complex macro-system. See MS graduate Jennifer Leaf\'s final project report covering the first phase of this project. Electronic Discourse Systems: The ConsensUs Project Electronic discourse systems have been developing since the early days of e-mail lists and bulletin boards. The Internet and various technologies enable large-scale e-discourse systems such as usenet and, more recently, Wiki collaboration. I have recently embarked on developing a new e-discourse system code-named \"ConsensUs\", which extends concepts of structured discourse for problem exploration and solving. This system will employ latent semantic analysis (think of Google\'s \"Similar pages\" feature) to aggregate and consolidate large volumes of commentary as a means of assisting moderators and managing information overload. The purpose of ConsensUs is to support global-scale discourse for global-scale problems like global warming/climate change. Current e-discourse systems do not seem to scale well. We hypothesize that the form of structure used and the use of semantic analysis, and other techniques, will allow ConsensUs to scale well. Additionally, while the alpha development system is being built on Web technologies, we plan to port the system to a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform such as Sun Microsystem\'s JXTA project. The ConsensUs Web site gives an (as yet incomplete) description of the project. This project is being developed by my students under the direction of myself and Don McLane. Both undergraduate and graduate students are participating in developing the initial code base. We plan to open this project up for open-source development once that base is in place. Stay tuned for further developments! Adaptive, Autonomous, Artificial Agents/Architecture It is now widely accepted that in order for artificial agents (robots and softbots) to achieve the level of autonomy and robustness that is desired for a number of important problem domains, these agents will need to be able to adapt to dynamic, uncertain environments. They will need to learn from experience and be able to predict future states of their environments based on a (probably) imperfect, acquired model of their world. The capacity to predict allows agents to not merely react to contingencies but to anticipate and act in advance of mission-impacting events. In this way preemptive agents can avoid dangerous situations or seek advantageous ones. To do this they need to exploit causal relations [412k including graphics] between environmental factors. An adaptrode-based learning architecture provides a means for agents to learn and use causal relations to become anticipatory and preemptive. The adaptrode is strongly inspired by biological learning. The model was derived from neurobiological and behavioral considerations (see Adaptrode Learning [114k including graphics] for the derivation and Adaptrode Learning in Artificial Agents [97k including graphics] for how it is employed. See the Adaptive Agents Lab Web Site Foraging search -- inspired by how animals find food -- relies on a causal relation heuristic.  It assumes that there are, associated with each sought resource object, a group of objects which have a causal relationship with the sought resource object.  Such objects are called \"cues\". In the absence of a cue (labelling a path out of a given node) a stochastic component selects a path randomly on each iteration of a depth-first-search.  If, however, a cue is detected, the agent switches to a directed search (best-first-search). The trick is in how the agent is to learn what constitutes valid cues.  I have been investigating the learning competence of the Adaptrode mechanism along with the architecture necessary to learn and use causal relations for guiding search.  I have extended the concept of foraging search into the realm of prototypical intelligence.  That is, the brain mechanisms needed to conduct foraging search behavior can be used to explain mental processes that we call thinking.  What interest me is the progression from reactive systems, through adaptive and anticipative systems, to intelligence.  Is it possible that anticipative behavior is the basic, possibly only, necessary one for the evolution of intelligence in animals?

Systems Science and the Political Economy Governance of an Economy A Sapient Political Economic System A Brief History of Evolving Social-Economic Governance In the blog post, Systems Science and the Political Economy I tried to show how the concepts of economics, social organization, and the political process are all intertwined and based on extended physiology — the interactions between the physiologies and psychologies of eusocial beings. I started with a primitive social system where the participants were starting to specialize by talent in the production of tools or services that were needed to keep the group successful and fit. As Adam Smith had long ago recognized, specialization and cooperation is the key to success of the whole enterprise (this latter observation was expressed in his lesser referenced book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments). In this post I would like to run through a brief recount of how social and economic governance has evolved through history. There is a single caveat to make: all of this history is based on the fact that the decision agents involved in both the general social organization/economy and the governance structures have been humans and only as sapient as the species had evolved in the late Pleistocene. In all likelihood early sapiens formed groups based on extended families. These groups were small, maybe twenty to fifty individuals across all ages. They were hunter-gatherers with a still relatively primitive set of tools consisting of digging sticks, stone blades and axes, and possibly thrusting sticks (spears). They may have scavenged meat more than hunted it but they had mastered the use of fire for cooking and hardening wooden shaft points. They probably built temporary shelters but were primarily nomadic, at least over a large territory, following food opportunities. This was the milieu in which we imagine the first specialists emerged. Certain individuals were good at chipping rocks, others good at finding root foods, etc. Men were probably the primary hunters and as tools like throwing spears and later bows and arrows improved we suspect certain individuals tended to excel in the hunt while others were good at butchering. If we can extrapolate from contemporary indigenous peoples\' organizations then the tribe was guided strategically by the wise elders, a council group, with perhaps a headman providing tactical leadership for hunting and conflicts with other groups when they occurred. I consider this as the root form of governance that evolved along with and because of human genetic evolution. Language was an integral part of this evolution as the organization of a primitive market of specialist agents undoubtedly required significant communication to coordinate activities. Aside from the time-to-time conflicts over territorial disputes, groups interacted with one another to trade special goods and especially brides to ensure against inbreeding. The main form of interaction within the group was cooperation even while that between groups vacillated between competition and cooperation (trade). Thus logistical management was probably minimal since all individuals could easily see everything that went on within the tribe and each individual\'s behavior was guided by a strong moral sense of what was best for the group. This root form persisted even after the discovery of horticulture as a process. Originally tribes, probably driven by climate changes in Africa, started settling in year-around camps where they could be assured of water and good soils. Effectively they were still tribes and they still tended to generate specialists, but now doing farming instead of hunting and gathering. Note, however, this was not a universal phenomenon. Some tribes in more arid areas remained nomadic and reliant on herding of ungulates for a living. These tribes would evolve a governance form that was more suited for a more demanding and constrained lifestyle. Early agriculture was wildly successful and tribal villages grew into larger many-family units. As the Mesolithic age transitioned into the Neolithic and later the Bronze age tools were evolving rapidly. The plow, drawn by oxen, for example, revolutionized agricultural practices and provided for an explosion in food production and, consequently, populations. With increasing complexity and decreasing transparency in terms of the work of specialists, the need for logistical management arose as did a class of ‘managers,’ such as the granary manager and the scribes who accounted for the volumes of grains and other food stuffs stored for future consumption. The need to protect farmlands and villages also called for some of the stronger men to become warriors from time to time. They needed weapons (built by specialists) and supplies when needed. Thus the interface between logistical and tactical management for protection was established. The same was true for trade with more distant settlements. Someone had to organize the trade excursions and then manage the artifacts and foods to be traded. Coordination management emerged as a class of people who did not get directly involved in the on-going production of food or the crafts that produced the artifacts needed to produce food and support daily living. The beginnings of a layered hierarchical management system emerged from the need to coordinate many specialized work processes and coordination specialists emerged from this structure. The bureaucracy was born. The question of strategic management is not easily discerned. As with the above described tribal organization, a council of wise elders and a headman or chief whose primary duty was to implement the strategic decisions of the elders may have morphed as the needs for tactical and logistical management grew more prominent. Once permanent villages were formed, in essence the strategy of life became fixed. Grow food to feed the population, protect the land, and seek out alliances for trade and protection purposes. The wise elders probably devolved into the function of advisors as opposed to leaders. The role of the headman evolved into that of mayors and later kings. They took more power as leaders and eventually “law givers.” The beginnings of autocracy and authoritarian rule vested in one individual were at hand. This is the point in cultural evolution when the selective forces that had favored increasing sapience were reduced. The selective forces for ruthlessness and power seeking from competition between the various coordination level managers for the leadership job took over. Most often, history tells us, the top dog was the one most honed in military capabilities. As regional populations grew and put pressure on the land, competition for resources (soil in particular) came to be a permanent pattern of interactions. Thus military men gained the skills in leading. This new framework for organization was incredibly successful. Within a seemingly short time small villages gave way to more elaborate towns and cities in key environments (e.g., Egypt and Mesopotamia). The age of civilizations and empires emerged and the complexity of life exploded. The surrounding farm villages and the farms themselves were somewhat unaffected by this transition in terms of daily life. But of course they became subservient to the city centers that now needed resources brought in from the surrounding land. A more elaborate military was needed to protect the towns and surrounding lands. Tactical management was raised to a new level. For some reason, however, logistics management in its full form never advanced beyond the issuance of currencies and collection of taxes, which are not really serving the economy so much as making the bureaucracy possible. Even as cities grew in complexity and workshops became increasingly opaque to their customers, the governing class left the logistics pretty much to the marketplace. They could get by with this approach only because the vast majority of humans are inherently motivated by cooperative moral sentiments. The proportion of cheaters was (and still is) relatively small by comparison with the cooperators and the instances of dispute could be managed by a magistrate judiciary. Occasionally truly egregious disputes and wrongs needed to be referred to a “higher court”, but for the most part the marketplace remained reasonably self-regulating[1] Rather than governments taking a direct hand in logistic management, by assisting the direct regulation of interprocess transactions and distribution of resources, a different, non-governmental form of logistic management emerged from the practice of sequestering excess foodstuffs for later consumption and as insurance against a bad harvest. Once abstract monetary tokens came into widespread use, they rapidly began to represent stored wealth and a new institution, the bank, arose as a means for sequestering these tokens. The idea that bankers should receive their income from a portion of each savings account was probably the first version of managing that resource. But very soon another practice came into existence. As with granaries that stored seeds and from which seeds could be borrowed, for example, to start planting a new field (an investment in the future), banks started lending small amounts of stored money to finance new trade ventures. And just as the granary needed to be paid back in full (with possibly a small increment more), the bank could charge a fee for the use of the money — interest payments. But here is where the twist came in. In order to convince the people saving their “wealth” in the bank that this practice was sound, they paid the savers a small fee for keeping their money in the bank and thus available to the bankers to make loans. This was the first foray of the monetary system into logistics (as described in A Sapient Political Economic System as the origin of “monetary policy.”) Banks loaning money out to borrowers effectively creates second-order money because it is cash that is supposedly existing in two places at once. It is both in the bank at least on the ledgers, and in the hands of someone else being used to buy things. If the savers want their money back, the bank would have to rob Peter to pay Paul, take out more money from other peoples\' deposits to restore the full amount of the account that is being withdrawn. The obvious risk is that if everyone wanted their money out at the same time the bank would not be able to give them their full due unless it could turn around and quickly pressure the borrowers to pay them back. Messy business. This basic pattern worked pretty well most of the time. The banking industry achieved full status as an institution and with due prudence became respected and trusted. But then, banks struck an unholy alliance with governments. They started loaning money, for example, to finance armies and navies for war efforts. Those loans could only be paid back if the wars were won so those were risky business deals. In any case bankers became influential in government affairs (see, for example, The House of Medici) and, indeed the financial machinations of bankers and those of political heads of state became extremely intertwined and remain so down to the present. In spite of numerous downturns and failures, the banking industry seems to have survived quite well. The next major “innovation” in financial management came with the invention of bonds and stocks. Capitalism is basically a set of ways in which an investment class, those with the financial resources, can lend their “excess” wealth, or what would have been called savings, to new ventures, not unlike the loaning of seeds to start new fields. As I wrote in A Sapient Political Economic System even today governments do not engage in true logistical management, preferring and believing that markets can solve all of those pesky distribution problems more efficiently than can people. This belief emerged and evolved into its current “free market” version as a result of the observations made by Adam Smith regarding the mythical “invisible hand.” Indeed, Smith was noting that there was a logistical function that seemed to be taken care of by self-interested parties working out trades in an open market setting. Smith\'s observation may have hit on an underlying truth about coordination even as it has been lost on those eager to use this observation as an excuse for maximizing profit taking. In one sense Smith\'s observation, made in much simpler marketplaces, is basically true, if the decisions are left strictly to people to make when all relevant information is available to them. But as I also pointed out, with proper scientific-based methodologies and an appropriate objective function those decisions could be based on facts-of-the-matter and not human opinion. Better still, with sapient agents there would be little question as to the efficacy of logistical decisions. The notion of a free market being the solution to all problems has been reinforced by the the failures of so-called planned economies. The few attempts that governments have made to “plan” an economy have ended fairly disastrously. The former Soviet Union comes to mind. China was going down the same road but has recently morphed from a communist state to a modified capitalist state with somewhat less planning and a good deal of new knowledge gleaned from watching the progress of the West and the failures of the Soviet Union. But even in the modern China we have evidence of the failures of their approach to logistic management. For example, China has a horrendous commercial real-estate bubble (as well as a private bubble) due to poor planning. Evolution of a Sapient Socio-Economic Management System If human socio-economic hierarchical management were to have evolved in ways that reflect a more “organic” form, what would be different between what was described above and some kind of “ideal”? This is an exercise (possibly in futility) to try and discern how such a system might be obtained. As a starting point, assume that there will be a reset of civilization. And not just to a lower technological civilization but to a very low technology collection of tribes. Let\'s consider what a future evolution of society might look like. Furthermore, let\'s consider what that evolution might look like in the case where the social agents, the people, have evolved greater sapience[2]. I suspect that the main difference at the operational level, the level where people are attending to daily life and production of goods and services will come from something that might look like altruism but is actually the result of desires to cooperate and to do what is good for society. The profit motive will have been reduced back to the need to make and save a small profit as a buffer against bad times. Indeed, when the larders are full and account for the average demand during those bad times, the producers of goods and services may elect to back off of volume and/or price. Volume could be adjusted based on demand/need and price could reflect the actual costs of production. There would be no premium to collect to take advantage of fellow tribespeople. Every producer would consider the whole of the society in setting prices and availability based on actual costs and availability of inputs. These are morally-motivated decisions and not profit-motivated. Operational level management is primarily concerned with quality aspects of products and services. Just as craftspersons of old cared about their reputation and thus paid careful attention to quality details, sapient producers would monitor their outputs for quality sake and make adjustments to maintain or improve that quality. But a big difference is a subtle shift from concern for reputation to keep sales up to concern for the customer\'s capacity to find value in the product or service. In other words this too looks a bit like altruism but is not because the producer is not compromised by performing the necessary acts. Indeed, both producer and customer are enhanced as a result of the synergy afforded by the product or service. Society is better off as a result of a qualtity product being used, possibly to construct another quality product. At the coordination level the question might be posed: If everyone is so cooperative and morally-motivated by their interactions in transactions, wouldn\'t the market be sufficient to provide logistic coordination? And it is likely that with agents who are more discerning and honest in their communications, the likelihood that the marketplace could serve as a sufficient medium for logistics is probably high. But only as long as the complexity of the web of buyers and sellers is relatively simple and the nature of products and services is also relatively simple. At the stage of social evolution where the farming community is the mainstay of society, then this condition probably holds and simple marketplace mechanisms along with the above mentioned cooperativity and motivations of the agents would lead to efficient and satisfactory outcomes. This is what Adam Smith observed in Wealth of Nations, at least in terms of the workings going on in the lower echelons of commerce. Unfortunately, higher forms of financing and obfuscated transactions were already developed and starting to negatively impact those lower echelons even in Smith\'s time. Just at the start of the Industrial Revolution, the bankers and lack of state-based logistics management were deepening the wedge between the rich rentier-capitalist classes and the poor working class. The moral sentiments that Smith also wrote about were fading. Recall the main tools of logistic management, the budget and the accounting system? The evolution of a true hierarchical cybernetic system would involve the employment of these to help producers and consumers regulate themselves at the operational level and maximize cooperation. For the society, the maintenance of a global accounting system would allow all members to have information about the costs of everything and the prices that reflect fair trade. Something akin to a financial accounting system would let everyone know and understand the state of the whole community. With that knowledge, sapient agents would be able to adjust their activities and expectations. In the early agricultural days, and even before in the hunter-gatherer stages, everyone in the tribe knew very well what the status of the whole tribe was with respect to food and other resource supplies. Everyone got complete visability when it came to the stores of those resources. They could then individually take whatever action would be necessary to do their part to maintain or improve the status of the group. A global accounting system, not just for the governing “agencies” but for every operation within the society, would provide this same sort of information for more complex systems. I imagine that at some point, as societies do grow within the limits imposed by the carrying capacity of the environment and by the availability of energy, there would need to be a function devoted to summarization and interpretation of the accounts. The information load from an accounting system, even for a moderate sized company requires a controller and financial managers to monitor the assets, liabilities, and equities as well as cash flows of the whole enterprise. Similarly, budgets relating to the whole community, the activities of individual producers and consumers would be employed to plan for resource allocations. Unlike planned economies such as tried in communist countries, budget development is not a strictly top-down process. Each operating unit provides input based on their operating experiences and the trends they see. For example, a producer may note an uptick in demand for a specific product and project the continuation of that demand increase. They would request additional resources to meet the demand and the budgeting process would ascertain the feasible allocations of resources given those requirements. The logistics coordinator would have to make decisions about actual allocations and their timing. But they would not simply decide one fine morning that making more “tractors” would boost the manufacturing sector of the GDP which would look good when reporting to their superiors. An approach to logistical management has simply never been tried in any economy. Yet it is the necessary form of management needed to deal with the kind of complexity found in societies beyond the simple village. Higher sapience would make this kind of management possible simply because people would not feel they have to hide anything. The sentiment of proprietorship and secrecy about what goes into production would be much minimized. Thus agents would be willing to participate in accounting reporting (cost and financial) and would be happy to have comprehensive information about products and services. However, the major driving sentiment behind a sapient logistic management system would be the a priori willingness, even desire, for all participants to cooperate for the good of the whole. Today, perhaps due to cultural aberration and pressures to conform, most people are primarily interested in maximizing their own situation. Fewer in number, but still enough to make things really bad, are those who hold that same sentiment and are perfectly aware that doing so will harm others, yet they do not care. Nothing could be further from a sapient mind. The form of tactical management would be as described in A Sapient Political-Economic System. But how would it evolve as societies evolved to greater complexity? Tactical management of a small community starts with attending to the state and trends associated with the community\'s environment. The very first problem is how to grow enough food to maintain the health of the community. But other issues include finding building materials for shelters and materials for making other tools. Under the assumption of a reset of social evolution with small communities and those are spread out, and with the members of communities having some greater level of sapience, it is not hard to imagine that the tactical issues of interacting with other societies would be trade of goods and genes. However there is also the trading of information that would need special attention. If one group is experiencing stresses, say due to poor harvests, they might share this information with the other groups nearby. They might find out that those other groups, too, were experiencing stresses. Then, the groups might find ways to symbiotically cooperate to find synergies that would help all through the rough times. At minimum they could agree to spread out further apart to lessen the total human load on the environment. Of course I am not saying this would be easy, but more sapient minds would be more likely to seek cooperative solutions than resort to violence. More sapient minds, armed with knowledge about how the world works, would be in a position to find solutions. More sapient minds, remember, are strategic as well as morally-motivated. They would be less prone to the US-vs-THEM psychology that dominates our weaker form of mind. Of course there is always the possibility that clusters of less sapient communities will have survived as well. Such communities are more likely to resort to violence in acts of desperation. Thus tactical management will also necessarily include military-like approaches for protection. There is nothing about higher sapience which precludes self protection. So, until or unless the lower sapient groups die off (due to unsuccessful competition with more sapient groups) the construction and maintenance of military capacity would remain part of the tactical management process. What would be different is the role that strategic management would take in all tactical affairs. Agents tasked with tactical management (e.g. monitoring the health of the environment and the activities of potential enemies) would necessarily consult with the those tasked with strategic management — the wise elders or, in the case of smaller communities, the wise leader. Strategic management is always concerned with the state and trends of the world around the community. They also keep themselves informed of the state and trends of things within the community, the logistics and operations. They know and think about the strengths and weakness of the community and the threats and opportunities in the environment. Their job is to wisely guide the activities, both logistical and tactical, for the long-term stability and maintenance of the community. Where do wise elders come from? Or a wise leader? If you read my working papers on sapience, especially about the evolution of sapience you would recall a discussion of the statistical distribution of sapience strength. In the extant population I conjecture that the distribution is not the ordinary normal curve but is quite skewed toward the low end of the scale. That is, the mean sapience level (like an SQ) is relatively low, with a rapidly declining tail off toward the high end. This is the result of the newness of the traits involved in integrated sapience. Given enough time in biological evolution and a continuance of selection factors favoring sapience, the curve would eventually tend toward normal (bell shaped). Well, if our reset populations are somehow more sapient that is what we would expect to see. And there will always be a minority (but a non-trivial one) of individuals who are much higher in the distribution just as there are people with higher IQs now. The Key to a Hierarchical Cybernetic System The key is good inter-module communications and veridical models for making control adjustments. Because no communication channel is perfect, there is always noise and ambiguity, nature learned a long time ago how to build communications systems with clever coding and redundancy. We humans have learned to do the same, but we low sapient humans have also managed to inject noise and ambiguity to hide reality from others we see as competitors (or suckers) and to hide from reality ourselves. We know how to do it right we just don\'t have the guts to do so. At every turn we can rationalize obscuring the truth by believing that everyone else does so and we are just protecting our own interests. In a sapient society, a wiser people would understand the importance of reliable and complete communications. Unlike in the game of “Telegraph” where everyone laughs about the mangling of a message passed on by whisper from one person to another wiser people would work hard to ensure the fidelity of messages they handle. This is not merely true within the marketplace but up and down the hierarchy of management. Workers would not hide mistakes from their coordinators for fear of punishment. They would be wise enough to realize that it is important to report problems so they can be fixed. They would have no fear because they also realize their coordinators are wise enough to understand that mistakes happen, things go wrong, and that it is not in anyone\'s best interest to punish anybody when they do. Similarly, the models of the subsystems used to make decisions must be as close to reality as they can economically be made to be. Models that are not sufficiently complete or riddled with ideological beliefs(such as the neo-classical, neo-liberal economics we mostly rely on today) that do not correspond with reality are worse than useless. They cause damage. In our current population of sub-sapient people beliefs in models of governance based on totally unfounded ideologies (and they are all pretty much this way) are the cause of our current crises in government, politics, and economics. They are the reason that our civilizations are collapsing in front of our eyes. Sapient beings learn from mistakes and that learning turns into more precise and/or accurate modelling of the processes that need to be managed. Models become more veridical as the system evolves. Ultimately, and I realize I repeat myself, a true hierarchical cybernetic system depends on the sapience of the decision agents at all levels in the hierarchy. While there may still be a statistical distribution across levels of sapience and intelligence, this need for all to be sufficiently wise in their judgements also implies a more egalitarian social fabric. Just because an individual is performing the role of strategic decision maker does not mean that that individual is “worth” more in material rewards for doing their job. Is this socialism? Is this the feared plague that is the antithesis of capitalism? Well yes and no. Egalitarianism among sapient beings is not the same as rewarding a lazy sub-sapient just because he is breathing. Higher sapience implies greater sentiments of responsibility and effort applied. Only if every participant in society contributes to the good of the whole can there be a true hierarchical cybernetic system. And only if the latter is achieved can there be a sustainable form of society and culture. I called this posting “The Evolution of Governance.” Many readers may have noticed that I then described what sounds like a “designed” governance system. However, I claim that even human designs are the result of evolutionary process. From the earliest times of Homo sapiens humans have tinkered and tested technology and organizations. The governance systems that have emerged over the history of man, especially since the advent of agriculture, show that these were merely experiments. So it is the same with the current experiment in liberal democracy and capitalism relying on an all-knowing market. This too is an experiment and one that has proven disastrous even as it produced untold material wealth. If humans can make it past an evolutionary bottleneck and if the average level of sapience can be boosted then the next experiment, built from what was learned by this last one and knowledge of hierarchical cybernetics should be an improvement. In some sense mammals and birds can be viewed as a kind of brain/mind organizational improvement over dinosaurs. But it took a major global calamity to give them the chance to emerge and evolve further. I take comfort in thinking that the next round of governance evolution, based on increased sapience and hypersociality will demonstrate the same kind of improvement in form and function. Nothing is “perfect,” only better than what came before. Footnotes [1] I forgot to mention in that previous post the role of the law, especially contract law, in helping to ensure transactions are conducted fairly. Their are laws mandated by Congress and there are laws that are subject to interpretation by the courts and the enforcement evolves according to the history of application. While these laws seem to be in place to regulate fairness and thus reinforce cooperation, they are not actually part of a logistical management framework. Rather they seem to be compensating for the lack of sapient-based cooperation that would preclude cheating and the taking advantage of others due to higher levels of empathy, etc. [2] Some readers will argue that perhaps sapience can be improved by learning or being influenced in childhood by being in a sapient community. Perhaps it will not require neo-Darwinian evolution to produce a more sapient group. That is indeed possible in my opinion. Certainly by comparison with the state of affairs at present even slight improvements in morally-motivated judgement would make a substantial difference. Coupled with an effort to maintain that knowledge of how the world really works that we have gained through science, it is conceivable that educating for wisdom would contribute significantly to a morally-motivated society. Then, as with all biological-cultural coevolution there would exist a return to the selection forces that gave rise to and promoted sapience in the first place. For purposes of this discourse either education for wisdom, or some directed selection for greater sapience will have similar effects.

They say it depends on your disposition. Do you tend to see the positive or the negative? The realist will pay only scant attention to the state of the situation, a snapshot in time. The real question is: In which direction is the quantity headed? In the case of the glass half full or half empty, is it filling or is it draining? For the Equinox we know the answer. In the fall, the days are getting shorter. In the spring they get longer*. For our global civilization of humanity one might ask: Are we getting more civilized or less? Is life getting better for more and more people or is it getting worse? In my view the world of man is at an Equinox right now. Can we tell if this is spring or fall? You can probably guess my choice if you have been reading many of my past postings. Nevertheless, enjoy the fading days. If your area experiences the so-called \"Indian summer\", enjoy that last drop of warmth. If not, get hunkered down for winter. Predictions are that it will be a doozy in the midwest. * Of course this only applies, metaphorically, for the northern hemisphere Posted at 01:18 PM in Biophysical Economics, Current Affairs, Education, Political Economy, Systems Science, The Human Condition | Permalink | Comments (0) September 06, 2014 How Does Nature Manage Complexity? [NOTE: I wrote this blog post a while back intending to put it up before the last several posts re: applying hierarchical cybernetics to political economics. Can\'t say why I forgot to post it, but perhaps it will help resolve some questions the readers might have developed in those prior posts. My apologies for any confusion.] Actually it is a trick question. Nature doesn\'t ‘manage’ complexity. Rather, systems evolve to higher levels of organization that end up managing complexity by the emergence of structures at a new higher level that act to coordinate the activities of subsystems at the lower levels. For example, the emergence of multicellular organisms was a result of life evolving structural mechanisms that increased the cooperation between cells. As cells within these organisms became more differentiated (specialized in different functions) over evolutionary time, the organisms complexity increased leading to a need for some cells to first facilitate cooperative behavior and then evolve further to become specialists in acting as coordinators. For example the evolution of cells that are sensitive to photoperiodicity and their secretion of chemical messengers that trigger or turn off other cell activities is a good model of this phenomenon. The phenomenon is evolutionarily very old and can be found in both plants and animals. What is important to note is that as systems evolve toward higher complexity (discussed below) the need for better coordination between the parts grows. If the system is successful in evolving coordination specialists then the system, as a system, has an opportunity to survive in the long run. If not, internal instabilities and/or competitions will destroy its integrity and it will cease to function as a whole. The question that should be posed is: How do systems of coordination evolve such that as complexity increases systems maintain their capacity to remain systems? Biological evolution is the paradigm example, but as we learn more of socio-biology we come to realize that human societies and their economic activities fit this model quite well. What is Complexity in Natural Systems? Complexity is a problematic word! There may be as many definitions of complexity as there are people who identify themselves as complexity theorists. So I will throw in my opinion on the matter. Then I want to explore the important issue of how complex systems are managed. The definition of complexity that I want to advance is rather technical. I am making this explicit in the textbook Principles of Systems Science. Here I will provide a summary of what we propose there to give you a sense of how we can look at the problems associated with complexity in society. Consider a system as a bounded set of component parts, down to some ‘atomic’ level. This may seem like an extreme reductionist program, but in fact it is a necessary starting point to grasp concepts such as emergence and evolution — much more holistic views. Atoms, however defined, come in many different kinds (for example in physics/chemistry elemental atoms). Each kind has common features, but at the same time some of these features have multiple variations (e.g. physical atoms all have electron shells but each kind has a different number of electrons and different numbers in their valence shells). Atoms of different kinds connect in ways that create combinational entities that are slightly more complex (e.g. molecules). These connections depend on energetics (e.g. covalent bonds in chemistry store energy). While the fundamental example I used is actual elemental atoms and chemistry, the concept applies more universally to all levels of organization. Chemistry is important in the model of how life emerged from some kind of primordial soup. But then, at higher levels of organization, say prokaryote life, the cells themselves become the atoms and interact on their own level. Individual human beings are the atoms of social systems. Their interactions are enabled by energy flow and when chance encounters occur, provide opportunities for new combinations of social structure to emerge. So the use of the term \'atom\' depends on the level of organization being examined. To generalize, atoms (of a system) have multiple ‘personalities’ that means they will interact in multiple different ways. Complexity can now be defined as a set of atomic types, along with the total numbers of each type and a set of potential interactions (see Fig. 1). This is actually what I like to call ‘potential complexity’ as opposed to ‘realized complexity’. The former describes an amorphous system prior to the flow of energy (i.e. at thermal equilibrium). When energy is pumped into the system it starts to drive actual interactions as the system moves further from equilibrium. Structures begin to develop, some of which are energetically stable under the conditions of the energy flows (see dissipative systems), thus forming more complex objects that have their own potentials for interaction (see Fig. 3). Realized complexity is time dependent and must be specified in terms of actual interactions (e.g. actual bonds formed) at any given point in time. Systems undergoing stable energy flows over very long time scales evolve their realized complexity to some ultimate state, which then constitutes a steady-state condition far from equilibrium[1].   Figure 1. Systems are comprised of sets of atomic types that combine to form slightly more complex ‘molecules’. At equilibrium (no energy flow) systems are an amorphous aggregation of these atoms. The number of kinds of atoms (only three different kinds shown here), the number of kinds of possible interactions between them (when energy is available), and absolute number of atoms in each kind constitute the potential complexity of a system at equilibrium. Slightly further away from equilibrium, as energy flow drives combinations and recombinations, combinations come into existence based on the above characteristics — what is possible — and eventually stable forms, each at minimum energy, obtain. These tend to have additional interaction potentials based on geometry and ‘unused’ interaction potentials (see Fig. 2). Note that combinations of atoms introduce geometric considerations, i.e. the “shape” of the combination becomes an important factor in further development.   Figure 2. Stable associations of atoms, under the conditions of energy flow, can begin to form yet higher level associations. Pictured here are bonds between two geometrically compatible ‘molecules’. The red interactions are generally weaker (have less energy) than the interactions holding the atoms together in either object so that the objects retain their identity as subsystems. However, it is also possible that the between-object interactions can be stronger than at least some of the internal interactions which can cause reactions that produce new entities. For example, many chemical reactions between molecules are of this type. But the general principle applies at every level in the organizational hierarchy, even for societal institutional interactions.   The description of how new structures emerge, so far, suggests a rather linear course of complexity evolution. A graph of complexity vs time at a constant energy flow, theoretically, is a logistic, S-shaped, technically a linear system. But in the real world atomic and higher level interactions can include some non-linear aspects, such as an all-or-none reaction. Chaotic, critical, and catastrophic subsystems can dramatically change the general linearity of system evolution. Indeed, these kinds of non-linearities create opportunities for systems to make dramatic evolutionary jumps in organization that, as we will describe below, result in better managed complexity without suffering some of the problems associated with the increase in complexity as evolution proceeds. Figure 3 shows the comparison of smooth (logistic) evolution to a more chaotic (realistic) version. The curve in Fig. 3B shows some dramatic leaps upward and even some possible declines in complexity due to catastrophic effects. This version may be closer to what Stephen J. Gould described as ‘punctuated equilibrium’ for biological evolution. But just as the low level patterns of combination formations, as given above, are true at higher organization levels, so too is the form of the graph in Fig. 3B true for those higher levels. Even social organizations show similar fits and starts form as they tend to grow.   Figure 3. A smooth logistic (S-shaped) increase in complexity in an evolving system (A) versus a highly non-linear increase (B). The latter may even include shorter periods of decline in complexity due to catestrophic events. However, as long as energy flows and there is ‘excess’ available energy the trend will be upward until all available energies participate in the maintenance of system complexity after which a steady state level of complexity emerges.   Natural systems evolve to higher levels of organization by undergoing the odd occasional shuffle in internal organization at lower levels due to non-linear interactions, changes in energy flows, or introduction of new components from outside. Such occurrences lead to new structures and functions that then are subject to internal selection. Then, on perhaps even rarer occasions novel structures emerge from selection and interact with other components at that level of organization. As shown above, new interactions can lead to yet higher levels of organization. The whole system is more complex but also subject to some new possibilities. Evolution is a drive toward higher organization and manifests itself in the form of organizational hierarchies. One way of looking at this is that material evolution, taking place in the thermonuclear fires of stars and the explosions of supernovae gave rise to chemical evolution in the radiant fields of stars (in dust clouds and on solid bodies like planets). That in turn, again in stellar radiant fields bathing planets (like Earth), gave rise to biological forms, which then began the Darwinian evolution we are most familiar with. That evolution produced ever more complex forms, eventually leading to primates and us. Then emerged the social organizations seen in some of our primate cousins but most complex of all in us. Our biological and social forms gave rise to complex technology and complex institutions. Roughly that is where we are today. All along the way the emergence of higher order complexity was based on the establishment of lower order complexity along with some kind of chaotic trigger leading to possible short term decrease in complexity but, so long as energy was available, the eventual long-term increase in complexity (see for example, Prigogine, Ilya; Stengers, Isabelle (1984). Order out of Chaos: Man\'s new dialogue with nature. Flamingo. ISBN 0006541151. Also, Morowitz, Harold (2004) The Emergence of Everything, Oxford University Press, ISBN13 978-0195173314.) The element of chance plays a role in the evolution of systems, of course. It is relatively easy to see that systems with very large potential complexity measures have many different possible outcomes in terms of specific subsystems obtained at any given level of energy flow (and availability; energies that only contribute to thermal modes will be destructive rather than constructive). The number of different feasible combinations at a given level of energy flow at steady-state is a measure of the uncertainty associated with making predictions regarding the precise configuration of a system in evolution. On the other hand, some combinations are inherently more stable (having longer lifetimes) or more easily made so that not all combinations are equiprobable. This gives rise to the evolution of conforming patterns that may have many variations on common themes but universal (highly conserved) features nonetheless. Readers might find The Law of Requisite Variety of interest for more on this topic. Complexity by itself is not necessarily a benefit to the system in the long-run. The problem with complexity is that it is a reflection of diverse specializations of components. And that can be a problem when there are a large number of components, each trying to do its own thing without paying attention to what other components are doing. Enter the need for coordinators. As with the example of photoperiodicity and the role of special photosensitive cells in regulating the activities or timing of activities of other cell types, components at any level of organization may evolve as regulation specialists. The animal nervous system is an obvious example. Animals with brains, even primitive ones, show how special tissues composed of neural cells evolved into specialist information processors, taking in messages from sensors and molecular moieties in the blood, computing a response, and sending command signals to other tissues to cause them to behave. All tissues/organs have local control through various kinds of closed-loop controllers, feedback regulation that keeps them performing within specifications. But whole bodies consist of many different kinds of specialized tissues and organs that must work in a coordinated fashion if the animal is to be healthy. The first evolutionary stage leading to body level coordination was the development of larger-scale homeostatic mechanisms where one tissue (generally located at the anterior, or head, end of the animal) monitors and signals another tissue when the latter needs to operate in a different regime from normal. For example the nervous system may process stressful conditions and signal the adrenal-producing tissues (e.g. the adrenal glands) to release adrenaline in order to boost the activities of other tissues (e.g. heart and breathing muscles) to respond to the stressor and possibly reduce the stress level. A sufficiently complex system needs a considerable amount of internal coordination. In the hierarchical cybernetic model this is called logistical coordination. It depends on specialized coordinators that monitor multiple subsystems and issue commands to achieve an optimal level of activity for the whole system even when this means sub-optimal performance for one subsystem. But also sufficiently complex systems are such because they are interacting with complex environments. And the more complex an environment is, the more stochastic (uncertainty) it is, leading to difficulties in those interactions. Systems need to obtain resources from the environment and expel wastes into that environment. That means the system must coordinate its own behavior with entities in the environment. Living systems that have to move about to make a living (animals) evolved elaborate external sensory apparatuses to obtain information about what the environment was doing. They evolved more elaborate brains for monitoring this flow of data and computing the information content. And those new coordinator processors, called “tactical coordinators” issued commands to the muscular system (actuators) to drive external behavior. In very large systems multiple such cooperation facilitators emerge, all with different spatio-temporal scopes and as often as not, competing among themselves for resources and lower-level objects to coordinate! Given enough time and energy these higher-level objects will find coordination options and yet again a higher level super coordinator(s) will emerge to coordinate the coordinators. The evolution of all living systems shows this pattern. For a more in-depth look at this recurrent emergence of coordination, please see my working paper on Cybernetics and hierarchical control. So-called super-biological systems (i.e. societies and ecosystems) can sometimes show a similar pattern. Primitive human societies clearly evolved a hierarchical management structure that became more elaborate (complex) after the advent of agriculture when coordination specialists formed layers of “officials” and militaries formed to protect the agricultural lands and populations. In the case of ecosystems that have reached or nearly reached a climax state and have been stable for long periods of time, the establishment of stable food webs with clear trophic levels have achieved a form of internal coordination. My favorite professor at the University of Washington, when I was an undergraduate in zoology, Robert Paine developed the notion of a “keystone species”, being a species that has a remarkably large impact on the balance and functioning of a specific ecosystem. I see this concept as the emergence of a regulatory feedback mechanism that acts as a coordinator over a significant portion of other species in the system. Ecosystems, however, do not have, as far as I can discern, any kind of tactical coordination functions. They do not have a way to sense the other ecosystems around them. Where they exist as clearly delineated systems, they are bounded by geographical and climatological conditions. They do not directly interact with other ecosystems except for the migrations in (invasions) and out that change the mix. Thus ecosystems are subject to possible disruptions from other ecosystems (especially, for example from the human ‘economic system’)[2]. I maintain, however, that human social systems have not really evolved (culturally) true hierarchical cybernetic systems to coordinate the society\'s economic activities. What we call government is only a poor shadow of a functional hierarchical cybernetic system. And as I argued above the latter is absolutely essential to manage complexity and have a long-lived whole system — in this case our global civilization. Societies have continued to evolve complexity through the invention of technologies that have accelerated the process. Today our cultural complexity far outstrips our ability to manage our society. This is the fate of coevolution between two systems with wildly different time constants, in this case between the human genome and human culture. The Problems for Societies Associated with Complexity Increase The reason this is important is that we are beginning to recognize a diminishing returns phenomenon relative to the increasing complexity of society. Joseph Tainter wrote an extraordinary book called “The Collapse of Complex Societies” (1990, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-38673-X.) in which he details how societies throughout history have evolved through the process of ‘problem solving’, which process led to increased complexity of institutions over time. He analyzed the way in which that increase in complexity eventually had lower payoffs, either by creating new problems (which then needed to be solved by increasing complexity!) or simply the fact that new solutions could not completely produce the needed results. Eventually, he pointed out, the benefits of increasing complexity peaks when the costs exceed the benefits and begin to dominate the process. Another factor affecting complexity of society is the invention of technologies that then require more care and nurturing (leading to new institutional requirements for effort to be expended). We generally think about technological developments making our lives easier, saving time and energy. But the fact is that each development carries many hidden costs in these areas. Technology users often find themselves taking more time attending to the requirements of operation (think how the Internet improves access to information, but how much time gets spent searching for that information). But more importantly, each advance in technology requires an army of technical support people and organizations to provide the services. Each advance adds to the general knowledge base and that base requires maintenance. In general, advances in technology contribute to increasing complexity. According to Tainter, then, at some point increasing complexity starts costing more than it contributes. Unfortunately, the human response to the problems arising from increasing costs is to try to solve those problems by increasing complexity even more. Thus this leads to a positive feedback that accelerates the decline and possible collapses of societies. Decline (and eventual collapse) is an inevitable result of increasing complexity in that society. History bears out that societies have developed and declined, so the evidence is rather strong that this theory has a lot of merit. Thomas Homer-Dixon has also advanced a highly related factor in social collapses having to do with the the flow of energies through the society. Complexity, is both driven by energy flow and enabled by it. That is, the availability of excess usable energy tends to find ways to be used! Humans are motivated to trade their own efforts for machines that take advantage of this excess (extrasomatic) energy and so are motivated to find inventions that allow doing so. Excess energy always tends to be used to increase complexity! This phenomenon is actually not unique to humans and technological invention. As I described above, the evolution of system organization is driven by energy flow and that organization that is stable (stabilized by evolutionary selection) contributes to energy being directed toward more useful work. Here useful work means building greater complexity. Now, as Homer-Dixon points out, any reduction in energy flow, such as when the Roman Empire experienced deterioration of its food and timber imports from the distant conquered lands, results in an inability to either generate new or maintain old complexity. Homer-Dixon and Tainter are both addressing different views of the same phenomenon. Energy flow drives the tendancy toward increased complexity within the system up to the point where there is no more excess energy in the flow. Afterwards, in the best case where energy flow is maintained in a steady fashion, the system could, in theory, maintain a steady-state level of complexity as in Fig. 3A above. But what happens if energy flow starts to decline as Homer-Dixon describes for the Romans? Diminishment of energy flow diminishes the capacity to maintain that level of complexity, which leads to diminishing support for the system and eventual collapse. Without continuing sufficient flows of energy, the attempt to increase complexity (solve problems) that Tainter talks about can only result in declining results. And that is the way in which collapse manifests itself. Today, for global society this paints a grim picture since we are in the early stages of the decline in major energy flows from fossil fuels. Our society, our technologies, our population size, and our ability to have machines substitute for our personal physical efforts have been made possible by the flow of excess available energy from those fossil fuels. Nothing else comes even close to providing the power needed to maintain our society. Diminishing returns on complexity and the threat of declining energy form dual problems for the continuation of any system. At the same time we have ample examples in nature where systems have reached a level of complexity and declines in energy flow that should have led to collapse, and yet they did not. Rather the system managed to completely reorganize in such a way that the negative effects of peak complexity were mitigated, allowing the whole system to continue operating in spite of, for example, lower energy flows. One can argue that what continues is really a different system, but the basic functionality of what that system performed do continue. Biological evolution provides many examples of this process of reorganization. What interests me is how can we learn from nature, how complexity can be managed such that it doesn\'t result in collapse per se[3]. The Evolution of True Coordination in Human Society Can biological evolution catch up with cultural evolution? What needs to happen to achieve true hierarchical cybernetic management of the human society, the political economy? If I am right about the fate of human evolution being adversely affected by the advent of agriculture, and if our technologies cannot prove to protect us from extinction, then an explanation for why we are not operating in a true coordination system is that we are simply not yet evolved to true sapience. Why? Coordination and the whole hierarchical cybernetic framework is based on communication and information/knowledge. The human modes of communication are a mix of inherited body and facial language (emotional) and symbolic, recursively productive language. These are inherently noisy and with our much less than sapient brains subject to a lot of misinterpretation. Couple this with the fact that low sapience means that our emotional and especially our self-serving side is quite predominant in our dealings with one another and you have the basis of a very imperfect information system. For a cybernetic system to work you must have reliable information systems. I can think of no better example of an unreliable information system coupled with a selfish psyche than the current state of the monetary system. Money, in its purer form is really just an information system that conveys messages about how much available energy there is for work (or also how much work has already been accomplished). Today money has lost its role in this regard because non-sapient, selfish humans have figured out how to temporarily debase its information quality so as to make it seem they have more of it and therefore are wealthy. And of course everyone else falls for it so they get by with it. Our emotional and cognitive relationships with money are a mess. It has become the end-all and be-all of our worth. Frankly the only way I see for biological evolution to catch cultural evolution is if either we halt cultural evolution, say through the collapse of society, or speed up biological evolution by intervening with, maybe, genetic engineering. The problem with the latter, of course, is that we have no idea what we are doing. We\'re not sapient enough to know if that would wise. We\'ve certainly raced ahead with many other technological solutions that have come back to bite us in the collective arse. More likely, in my opinion, our civilization will collapse under the weight of population, overbearing complexity, and diminishing energy flows. If there are survivors, maybe they can give humanity a chance to finish the business of evolution naturally. My speculation is that if humans were ever to evolve greater sapience (and I\'m convinced that the evidence for this possibility is quite strong) then a natural hierarchical cybernetic system would emerge in their socio-economic systems. They would be able to communicate (for example would have much greater empathy yet much better control over emotions) and would see to it that their communications provided real information. Our current species is a lot closer than you might think when looking around at all the foolishness found in our world. With just a little more time and the right environment... Footnotes [1] The whole subject of energy flow is quite technical. Among several issues there is the ‘kind’ of energy (e.g. photons, electron flow, etc.), the gradient potential (e.g. brightness, voltage) and the coupling with components, or how the energy affects the interactions between components (e.g. endothermic or exothermic). These issues are important and I do not want to ignore them, but they could fill volumes to do justice. The term “exergy” is a term that encapsulates all of these issues. Exergy is the energy available to do work. For example to form chemical bonds or move molecules (or people) from place to place along the gradient. [2] Speculatively, sapient human beings could, I imagine, become the tactical facilitators for ecosystems. With enough knowledge of ecology and life in general, humans could monitor all of the potentially interacting systems and mediate in such a way as to help each system obtain its needed resources and disperse its wastes without harming the others. Which, if taken for the whole globe would amount to becoming the logistical coordinator for the Earth. Of course our species isn\'t sufficiently sapient and if we were we might discover that the Earth doesn\'t need a coordinator! What makes me speculate on this is that the emergence of coordinators has been the rule in evolution, not the exception. Ergo as the Earth perhaps approaches a steady-state dynamic, humans as the “brains” of the planet might not be so out of line. [3] Of course any massive reorganization, while preserving the functionality of the system, is going to feel like collapse to any sentient participants. The end of the world as we know it will be traumatic. But it is important to understand that it is ONLY the end of the world as we have known it and not the actual end of the world period. Posted at 04:36 PM in Biophysical Economics, Current Affairs, Evolution, Political Economy, Sapience, Systems Science | Permalink | Comments (5) August 30, 2014 A Sapient Political Economic System Prior Posts in this Series Systems Science and the Political Economy Describes the basic nature of economics rooted in the physiology and psychology of the economic agents, in this case us. Examines the nature of markets of agents in which cooperation is needed for the operations of complex specialist work. Also examined is the nature of complex systems evolving governance through hierarchical cybernetics principles. Governance of an Economy Derives the biophysical economic system from principles of energy flow, work, and consumption as seen in living systems. The biophysical economy is an extended living system. Human economic agents are examined, particularly in how they bring a new cognitive capability to the economic system. An earlier blog post: Is there a Sapient Form of Governance? examined the use of hierarchical cybernetics in forming a ‘working’ government. Needing Sapient Agents In the first post in this series I started with the analysis of economic agents and, in particular, human agents. The economy (in whatever form it takes) is the emergent function of multiple such agents doing work and exchanging products and services. They have to make decisions about what, when, and how to produce those goods and services. They also need to make decisions about what, when, and how much to exchange for. Those decisions are relatively easy to make in small communities with simple market mechanisms. The agents have access to sufficient information regarding relative efforts in production, and therefore relative value in making exchanges. Additionally, humans bring considerable judgment capacity to the marketplace. Their decision making can be handled subconsciously most of the time because they have access to a rich storehouse of tacit knowledge; they have had experiences with all of the other agents and have constructed models of them in their own minds. This deeper form of judgment is based on humans\' possessing a new mental capability I have termed “sapience&rdqu; and have identified it as the brain basis for wisdom. My working papers on this subject can be found here. I am currently working on a book based on these papers. Sapience emerged from older brain processes to provide humans with the many features that make humans different from other animals and even the apes. The good news is that it evolved as a means to allow humans to be more cooperative and what has been called hypersocial (eusociality based on empathy and cooperativity). Group selection intensified group cohesiveness. Humans form societies due to their need to be a part of a group of like-minded individuals. However there is some bad news. The capacity for sapient behavior only emerged some 150k to 200k years ago and does not seem to have progressed much. In fact, I suspect that the further evolution of sapience was halted after the development of agriculture. The reason is that one of the new aspects of sapience was the capacity of each individual human to think strategically. But, as I mentioned in my first post, that capacity is rather weak in most people. Agriculture depends on tactical and logistic thinking, already a feature of the human brain. Thus while these capacities may have been more actively selected for, the need for strategic thinking, emerged to help small human groups survive in complex and changing environments, was greatly diminished and, therefore, it was not strongly selected for. And here we come to the crux of the problem for the complex human economy. We no longer have relatively simple work processes and relatively small markets to establish values. And we do not have very sapient agents making strategically governed choices. Our current model of economics poses humans as “consumers.” There is a tacit recognition that consumers don\'t make rational choices which is why advertising seems to work. Consumers can be easily persuaded that such-and-such a product will improve their “social” lives. And consumers don\'t have to know a thing about how the product was made, or how much resource input was used. All they need to know is that others buy the product and are willing to pay $x for it. The list of problems with current economic models, all of which now come down to the notion of profit taking, are legion. I\'ve written much about the trouble with capitalism and the philosophy of growth, so I won\'t rehash that here. The fundamental problem, however, is the profound lack of wisdom on the part of humans as economic agents. They have become completely incompetent to make sound judgements on just about every front. Worse yet, they are incompetent in recognizing the value of wisdom or who might actually be wise enough to be put in leadership roles. It occurred to me that it would help to better understand what is wrong with the current politico-economic system if we could compare it with a system based on sounder systems principles. Among those principles, the nature of a sapient agent is requisite in order to have a functional process that leads to beneficial outcomes for the whole society. Since the vast majority of people in this world seem deficient in this regard (present company surely excepted) the achievement of a “sapient” system is, of course, not really feasible. At least it isn\'t under current circumstances. Post-bottleneck, I suspect, many more otpions will open up for humans to resume evolving toward true sapience (eusapience). Distant future politico-economic social systems might actually look like this. Wise Decisions What is something worth? This is the key question that a sapient agent needs to answer. From a systems perspective the answer is not that difficult. Any product or service that increases the availability of free energy is of value, that value being a function of the amount of increase in free energy. This is because it is the increase in free energy that contributes to long-term sustainability of the system (here meaning the society as a whole, not just the individual). Clearly, to mediate this kind of judgement, a wise individual must have the whole of the social good in mind (subconsciously). Selfishness can have no priority here. Profit is not in the increase for the individual but for the whole of society. Since wisdom is a function of both sapience and age (experience) the determination of value is probably not left to the younger members of society. Contrast that idea with our current focus on influencing the young to buy, buy, buy. The potential wisdom of youth is in recognizing the superior judgements of the elders and acceding to it. Our current species does not display this propensity. A wise economic decision would be based on the true societal value of a personal acquisition. Consider, for example the purchase of a home. What is necessary in the function of a home? In the current low-sapience society homes are statements of status. They are part of our remaining pecking-order mentality. If a home is viewed functionally as a shelter and comfortable place to maintain a domicile then the need for McMansions is eliminated completely. The home can have a minimal ecological footprint and still provide comfort and shelter. Homes that are functional without being excessive would be beneficial to both individuals and society. The most fundamental judgement of worth revolves around the notion of an object (or process) as a ‘tool.’ Tools are things that reduce the amount of free energy that is expended in a work process, or increase the availability of free energy to society. Because of the high energy return on energy invested (EROI) of fossil fuels, over the last three centuries, we have not focused on conservation or prudent choices in their uses. As a consequence we have produced implements that have been directed at convenience and entertainment. As a result, very few implements today could be classified as tools, as I have defined them. Take the automobile for example. The modern car is, just like the home, a statement of status or personality rather than an efficient tool for transportation. Even the need for transportation has changed from necessary (to do work) to discretionary (for convenience or to play). The consumption of fossil fuels and the concomitant dumping of CO2 into the atmosphere and hydrosphere have huge strategic consequences that still do not resonate with the average person. They might be fearful climate change or peak oil but generally do not really see that their own beliefs in profit taking or getting rich are at the heart of the whole set of problems. Decisions with Economic and Social Consequences Another kind of decision that does not, at first glance, appear to be economic in nature is that of procreation. A long time ago having a sufficient number of children to help parents with the chores of living was a “no-brainer.” Infant mortality was a problem so couples were hedging their bets by having more children (in some societies understanding of how to control population actually existed, so idea that we are just blindly making babies is just a modern rationalization). Today we have the belief that a growing population is necessary in order to keep the economy growing! What incredible circular reasoning! And what incredible stupidity. Society only needs more children to maintain a viable breeding population. It does not need to grow to maintain economic health. A society of wise individuals with a truly wise leadership would understand this and arrange their reproductive activities accordingly. Reproduction can be decoupled from sex for enjoyment, even using natural methods. Sapience allows this benefit. All decisions that a human agent makes have some kind of economic consequence. Thus all decisions need to be made wisely. What does this actually mean? Markets with Sapient Agents If all of the agents in a marketplace are making wise decisions then a market can provide a good medium for cooperative transactions. Everyone can get what they need and produce those things that others actually do need. Competition Competition, per se, is not a bad thing. It is what is needed to act as a selection process in ratcheting up the quality of goods and services. But in the current Zeitgeist competition for profits leads to all kinds of unwise decisions. Instead try to imagine multiple agents whose primary motive is to produce a good or service that people actually need and to produce it with very high quality. Remember the days of craftsmen? Very few of us do because the modern capitalist system focuses on maximizing sales. Under that kind of goal where is the motivation to produce something that will last a very long time and provide quality performance? Planned obsolescence has become the modus operandi for many producers. Producing high quality goods that are durable is rare except in very high priced goods like automobiles and houses. But even there the effects of competition are starting to have negative consequences and producers are increasingly cutting corners to protect sales volumes and profits. Look at how many more automobile recalls you\'ve heard about in recent years. A sapient agent sees competition in much the same light as an amateur sportsperson does. Competition helps drive self improvement in an evolvable system. But that means the system has to change. Non-sapient beings often find it hard to change. An evolvable agent is one that can learn, especially from mistakes, and adopt new ways, new realities in order to persist and thrive. Contrast that with the capabilities of so many modern business managers. With the emphasis on profitability, managers are essentially forced to think only about expediency and short cuts. For the sapient agent, seeing another producer make an improvement that is actively selected for by the market is a signal to make changes, to learn and try to win back selective support. Indeed, in the ways of sapient agents the competition could lead to outcomes such as increased cooperation, say through amalgamation of efforts. Sapient producer agents would be sensitive to the market messages and be ready to give up proprietorship if they are “bested” in a competition. Join forces and win at life. In a steady state economy producers are not trying to grow in the same way as occurs now. They are just trying to meet the needs of the market without trying to ‘expand’ the overall market. If they make an improvement to their product, in the sense of increasing the net energy flow to society, then their market share, in the case of multiple producers and multiple consumers, may indeed increase at the expense of other producers. But if the producers are all sapient, they will grasp that the improvement is being selected for and either emulate that improvement or attempt to make improvements of their own. Sapient consumers (which is almost and oxymoron!) who are still voting with their money would likely have some sense of “brand” loyalty and return to their previous supplier after they had begun to produce a better product. Competition has a legitimate role to play in nature. Competition can be bloody, of course, unless some natural feedback mechanisms are constraining the competitors for the good of the whole. For example there are many examples of polygamous rutting males (e.g. stag deer) who compete for mating rights with fights. But the fights most often do not lead to deaths because the competitors instinctively recognize the winner and will withdraw. The winner is the stronger (or smarter) one and whatever genetic advantage it had will be good to pass on to offspring for the good of the herd. Sapience raises this to the level of consciousness. Competitors are able to see the good of improvements and be ready to accommodate them by learning and adapting. Cooperation Markets could be efficient mechanisms for transactions if the agents were sufficiently sapient. Consider the producers. A sapient producer, not motivated by maximizing profit, would produce things (and services) that others benefit from in a more holistic sense; in the sense of increasing the availability of free energy to society. For example in the house case above, the builder would build a house that serves the basic needs of the family without trying to expand so-called amenities to coax a bit more profit from the sale. The family making the purchase would not be looking for something more than met their exact actual needs (not wants as we have come to know them). McMansions are a stupid waste of resources[1]. More sapient beings are more prone to cooperation as well as less interested in maximizing profits. Their view is far broader and deeper in time. They are cognizant of what is good for the whole society and not driven strictly by what is good for themselves alone. This is an interesting combination of empathy, mutual altruism, and cognition. Humans are not just subconsciously driven to be cooperative, they feel and are consciously aware of their desire to be cooperate. Except, of course, when they are overshadowed by ideological beliefs that they are only going to be successful if they selfishly find ways to maximize their own benefits even at the expense of others. Again, this is the result of the evolution of sapience having just gotten off the ground, as it were, and that the capacity is still weak in our species. Still, the tendency is there if you know where to look. And when conditions are right (low stress, for example) it is clearly evident. Throughout the history of life (and even pre-life) Competition has eventually led to improvements that enabled cooperation to take over. The latter led to the emergence of new levels of organization, as when specialist bacteria joined forces to produce the eukaryote cells. And later, eukaryote cells joined forces to produce multicellular organisms. We see this exact same thing in the older economy. Specialists improved their skills and eventually became mutually interdependent on one another. Specialists are not self-reliant. The economy is like a cell, or an organism. Wholly dependent specialists rely on every one else doing their jobs. And they cooperate in order to survive. The remnants of competition confuse the situation. And particularly in an age of ideological nonsense. The latter can only be blamed on the low level of sapience that the players posses. Exchanges without Profit All that is really needed to make the marketplace work is that money actually represents the work effort of making things. If money can be understood as energy, that is needed to do useful work, then prices can be related to actual effort and not based on some arbitrary number that is established by social perceptions and the desires of the producer to make profits at the buyer\'s expense. Prices should reflect actual costs. There could be a small margin of profit that reflects a buffer required to protect the production system. For example, a profit that could be banked for investment in maintenance would be appropriate. This was the original purpose of depreciation (which now is used as a tax dodge!) It is entirely appropriate to counter the effects of entropy to keep a system working properly. And repair work often has a step function look, i.e. it is necessary to accumulate re-investment funds because repairs and maintenance are usually performed at discrete intervals. A reasonable question might be: “how do you bootstrap operations to start producing goods and services?” This is the fundamental question that is supposedly answered by capitalism. People invest their savings under the presumption that they will enjoy a return on investment; in days gone by this was realized by dividend payouts. Today, the profit motive has overtaken the basic notion of return on investment such that investors no longer think about long-term (and modest) returns. They want immediate payoffs which is what drives the stock market and subsequent volatility. Thus the original idea of capitalism as a means for subsidizing new operations has been totally perverted (a similar argument is made for banking loans). Tnis becomes a problem for logistic management rather than something that can be solved by markets. Markets can only work with the exchange of information as much as the exchange of goods. Information must be veridical, without distortion by non-sapient agents seeking leverage over their fellow beings. Clearly this is not the case in our current economy. There is a simple word for the aspect of sapience that is operative here: honesty. People are not now sufficiently honest for two reasons. First, their brains hide the reality behind rationalization. They have learned from their society that greed is good. And they can justify their own greediness as a social norm. Secondly they actually do not know what the reality is. They are so blinded by those same social norms that they are truly ignorant of the reality. Logistic Management Logistic management refers to the coordination of work processes within the system. It involves two basic functions. The first is to provide coordination between work processes so that the whole system is kept within balance. The second is to allocate resources among work processes according to the needs of the whole system. Occasionally this might mean some processes do not get what they need for “normal” operations. The mechanism for keeping balance in operations is the “managerial accounting system”, the method of keeping track of the flows of materials (inventory) and the health of work processes within the system as a whole. The second is managed using a budget, a device for allocating resources according to a plan for the whole system. Both require on-going optimization computations. An objective function, e.g. cost minimization in the case of the accounting system and fair allocation in the case of budgets, drives the process subject to various constraints and requirements. More sophisticated computational methods such as linear programming, or some variant, bolstered by statistical analysis of data, are is used to refine the models (accounts and budgets) over time. The managerial information system integrates these two basic tools providing managers (decision agents) with information about the performance of the interacting work processes. Actual expenditures can be compared with budgeted expenditures, for example, to signal when something is out of alignment. Managers can then investigate these error signals in a manner similar to the error signal feedback in operational level management and then command corrective actions that encompass all of the work processes that are involved in generating the errors. In the United States the government has established two agencies to, in theory, handle these functions. The “Budget and Accounting Act of 1921” created the Bureau of the Budget, which was later called the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Its purpose was to analyze requests for funding from other government agencies and to make recommendations to the president as that office prepared a national budget. The second agency created was the the “General Accounting Office”, later renamed the Government Accountability Office (GAO). This office is non-partisan (in theory) and provides audits and other kinds of investigations of other agencies to the Congress. On paper this looks like it covers the notions of logistic management methods. But there are several hitches. First, these offices are not tied to the economy as a system. They only apply to government expenditures (the Internal Revenue Service handles the major source of revenue). In the current dominant political theory the government only exists to provide protection for the state and citizens and infrastructure needed by the whole state. Thus government expenditures are ostensibly related to the military and things like building and maintaining interstate freeways. However this is not really the case. Over the history of the executive branch of the US government (and this is reflected in state governments as well) it has become obvious that the government has a seemingly legitimate role to play in regulations of industries, the environment, public health, and myriad other functions that expand the notions of protection and infrastructure. The above two functions can be applied to the operations of all of these agencies but that does nothing in terms of providing logistical coordination between and among all of the various economic entities, firms and households. In the faith-based belief that free markets are completely capable of providing adequate coordination in the general economy, the government we have adopted has very little impact on how the economy works. Its two mechanisms, one of which is actually not part of the government officially, are based on so-called fiscal and monetary policies. In the case of fiscal policy the government has to collect taxes and can purchase services from independent contractors, thereby pumping money into the economy (very Keynesian). Tax rates on different segments of the economy presumably encourage or throttle various activities. More recently a third kind of mechanism has been developed in the form of fines levied against regulated industries for non-compliance. For example the Environmental Protection Agency, in the US, levies fines for private sector companies found to be polluting the environment. Ostensibly this is supposed to encourage compliance but it has been found that the fines are inconsequential and that companies would be better off paying them or hiring lawyers to fight them if they choose. Monetary policy is the other supposed coordination mechanism. This has to do with the macro economic effects of expanding or contracting the money supply of a country. It is believed (again faith-based) that such effect will keep the economy running smoothly, keeping inflation at bay and maintaining full employment. Generally the monetary policy is vested in the authority of a central banking system such as the Federal Reserve Banks of the US. In theory, again, this keeps fiscal and monetary policy choices effectively independent, which is believed to be a proper approach. Except, of course, when it isn\'t. Neither policy approaches are meant to actually coordinate the economy. They act more as large-scale boundary influences, one supposedly boosting economic growth and development, the other keeping the system within nominal ranges so as not to overheat or fall into recession. Actual experiences over the years have shown that these two policies interact to affect the economy\'s stability as measured by growth or decay of the gross domestic product (below). The strongly held belief in market economies, capitalism, and democratic governance prevent many countries from engaging too much in direct interventions. Such would be seen as being a form of the failed planned economies of communist states in the 20th century. However, the current model and the planned economy model do not exhaust the possible set of models that include real logistic management. More on that below. Businesses, on the other hand, are dictatorships! They are organized for top-down command and control, much like the military. All organizations, independent of their stated missions, use logistic management methods to control the internal operations for maximal achievement by the whole system. “For-profit” organizations use profit as their metric for such achievement. “Non-profit” ones use non-loss of funds as theirs. The military has other metrics to pay attention to. The metric most often used at the economy governance level, these days, is the gross domestic product (GDP), a made-up number that is supposed to measure the health of the economy. More to the point, it is the growth of the GDP which everyone believes measures that health. Since I have waxed eloquently in past blogs about the stupidity of this notion, I\'ll leave it at that. The point here is that the governance of the economy, for any metric of achievement, is shackled by the ideology of small government and the lack of tools for adequate logistic management. There is no accounting system in the same sense as used by organizations. The so-called government accounting office basically makes up statistics. And the GDP is nothing like the “bottom line” used in business. It is a completely made up number. The methods for computing it have changed at the whims of whatever administration was in power. And the budget? This actually comes a little closer to the way budgets are used in organizations, in that they are developed based on an enumeration of objectives with prices attached. The problem is that these objectives are pretty much based on fantasy. Take what we call “pork barrel” items (please!) These are good examples of line items that are not integrated into the budget for the good of the whole nation. Quite the contrary. They represent selfish interests and imagined regional benefits, and generally can be shown to be at the expense of everyone else. So, what would a sapient logistic management system look like? Ah! There\'s the rub. Here is the first real problem in terms of the interface between a governance system and the economic system. Governance philosophy based on hazy notions of democracy is doomed to failure with non-sapient citizens. Just look around yourself at the state of politics and government in the US now. So-called democracy is failing miserably. The government is failing miserably. The economy is failing miserably. Why? The citizens are not sufficiently sapient (to be wise). The government agents are not sufficiently sapient. In short, we are a society of fools and idiots who cannot see the whole picture and who do not really care for anyone else but our own selves. In a sapient society I imagine that more cognizant and surely more caring people would not look for pork-barrel deals. They would not elect idiots to offices of government. Democracy, as we have been experimenting around with it is largely a failure. If there were truly sapient beings in our world then a kind of meritocracy would work best. That is, we would look to the wisest among us to lead and provide governance. If that were the case, the government would not make up numbers, it would find a meaningful metric of well-being for society and the environment and collect data (an accounting system) for monitoring and analysis. It would provide legitimate logistic management. But for the sake of argument, lets suppose that somehow sapient beings were involved in governance. What would a true logistics management system look like. First we need to have an overarching objective function, one not based on the fallacy of eternal growth. To me this is actually quite simple and based on a systems approach. Given that the Earth can only support a certain population at any given technology level (and kind) without doing harm to the rest of the Ecos, we should seek to maximize the wellbeing of that population. Wellbeing should not be defined by simple material wealth as seems to be the case in neoclassical economics theories. Rather it is defined in a manner similar to the “gross national happiness index,” but substitute the word “global” for “national.” I have written before about the indication of success of a society was in the number of people who were self actualizing as a result of the society being organized to promote that healthy state of psyche (see: The Goal - Episode I: The Basic Requirement). The combination of seeking self actualization with doing no harm to the Ecos is the strategic framework for human society. We will discuss the ‘doing no harm’ aspect under the heading of tactical management. The achievement of managing an economy for the wellbeing of the citizens is the role of logistical management. We\'ll start with this idea of monetary policy. I have written extensively about what money really is (e.g. see: What is money, really?) especially in Biophysical Economics blogs. Put simply, I claim that money is nothing more than a form of message (in systems science/cybernetics sense) that conveys information regarding the control of free energy (the energy available to do useful work) or reflected in fixed (embodied) energy (value). Money is an incredibly useful tool for communications regarding the future feasible work that can be done as well as the work that has already been done. Thus a monetary policy and instrument would be to set the supply of money in circulation based on the energy available and the embodied energy in physical assets. For example, if the free energy supply goes down, as it currently is doing thanks to peak oil and diminishing energy return on energy investments, then the money supply needs to contract to reflect the fact that less work will be done in the future. This can be a signal to the logistical managers that current energy resources may need to be channelled into developing new energy sources to prevent decline in the population\'s wellbeing. Alternatively, if energy sources are increasing for some reason, this would signal channelling resources into education and the arts to improve the quality of life for everyone. The energy signal is a reliable way to anticipate the future. This leads us to the nature of both an accounting system and a budgeting system. Energy is a real, measurable quantity (though free energy comes in different forms that are coupled directly with the kind of work it can do, e.g. electricity is distinct from thermal). An accounting system that resembles corporate accounting, but measured in energy units, and into which every single economic entity supplied data is not outside the realm of possibilities (if we can keep the Big Data systems going!) This would supply the basis for the monetary policy just mentioned as well as be the basis for establishing budgets. Moreover, in an economic system that is trying to maintain a high level of human wellbeing rather than maximizing profits for a few rentiers then that accounting system could be the basis for establishing baseline values for products and services, thereby bringing a level of transparency into the marketplace not seen since the establishments of open air markets in villages occurred some ten thousand years ago. If truly wise agents were responsible for analysis and decisions such a system would provide the true form of logistic management that is currently missing in political economy. Tactical Management In a hierarchical cybernetic system tactical management is involved with the coordination of the system\'s actions with the state of the environment and with what entities in that environment are doing at any moment. Basically the system is looking to obtain resources it needs for continued existence and looking to offload waste products. But the catch is that the system cannot expect to extract those resources as fast as possible nor dump its wastes as fast as possible. And this is the basic problem with our current economic system in the Ecos. Capitalism demands taking the most out as fast as possible to make profits. It also demands that wastes be dumped at no costs to protect those profits. In ordinary biological systems these tendencies are kept in check by external forces acting as negative feedback to down-modulate the system\'s activities. For example a natural population of carnivores is kept in check by the availability of prey. Yeast populations are kept in check by the build up of alcohol concentration in a vat of wine. But for the human economic system these natural sorts of mechanisms have been transcended by human ingenuity, at least up till the present. Humans have, through their cleverness, managed to break free, at least seemingly, from the normal biological constraints that have been operative on other species. At least for a while it has looked like humans had escaped the normal process of negative feedback. But reality is catching up. It is now becoming clear that we have been doing a lousy job of tactically managing our interactions with the Ecos. If our objective had been to sustain existence for an indefinite amount of time, we\'ve done a poor job of it. Somehow, physical reality always seems to prevail in the end. Part of the problem is due to the lack of actual strategic management (below). Tactical management will only carry out the objectives set by strategic management. And if those are lacking (ambiguous or lacking entirely) then what is the outcome. In the case of the capitalist based economic system with no governance input at the strategic level the tactical decisions are left to the discretion of capitalists. That means profits at all costs. Resources come from the land, the ground. Whoever owns the land owns the resources and can obtain profits by extracting those resources and selling them to the highest bidder. Since the beginning of the hominids territories have been important, and competition between groups for space has been a mechanism for maintaining balance but at the cost of individual freedom from fear. Managing a territory was superimposed on the dominance hierarchy (pecking order) scheme for establishing reproductive rights. “Headmen” emerged as dictatorial rulers in the hominin line and we have been cursed with this throwback well into Homo evolution. After the advent of agriculture and long-term settled communities the pattern stuck and tactical management became the domain of the ruler or ruling class. And, given the underlying biological mandate to grow, the consequences have been to expand the human dominion over the Ecos as well as conquest of other human settlements (later cities and states). The lack of sapience in this scheme is palpable. Sapient tactical management would mean humans are sensitive to their natural environment and the changes their activities might render to it. For example, the early civilizations in the Mid East (e.g. Mesopotamia) would have noticed the impact of overgrazing sheep and continuous depletion of soils and worked to stop the desertification of that region. They did not. The rest, as they say, is history, literally. Humans have been very unwise in their management of the land. And this is not for lack of knowledge. In fact many a wise elder did recognize the impacts of human economic activities in a growing population and warned their fellows of this problem. Alas, the majority of so-called “leaders,” emulated today by our lead politicians and pundits, ignored the warnings for the sake of growing material wealth and pursued very unwise policies of expansion and exploitation to the maximum. As a result civilizations fell, just as our current global civilization is about to fall. Sapient tactical management would, as in the hierarchical cybernetic model, be in close communication and coordination with the logistical management system. Specifically, the energy accounting and budgeting system provides a great deal of information about what the tactical system should be doing. The tactical system should first consider the flow of energy and its uses in the work of the system but also in the recycling of wastes or disposal of non-recyclable wastes. It has to provide feedback to the logistical management system when either energy sources are diminished or waste disposal is overwhelming the Ecos. Either of those conditions signal a diminishment to human welfare. The logistic system can take precautions even while the tactical system seeks ways to re-establish balance. The tactical system needs to keep an assessment of natural resources available and the rate at which they can be extracted without harming the Ecos. That means they must be science based, not profit maximizing. Some of the same kinds of optimization tools used by the logistical management system can be brought to bear on extraction and disposal mechanisms but only if good science and careful measurement are employed to obtain the data. For example, the US Geological Survey (USGS) is an agency that, in theory, measures and reports the accessibility of resources. The main weakness of this agency, however, is that it is reporting for the benefit of profit-making extraction enterprises and so includes an automatic bias in its method. It tends to be overly optimistic in support of economic expansion. Once more both the science and accounting computational power are currently available to do these jobs correctly. In many ways agencies like the EPA and USGS are doggedly trying to fill the roles. But invariably politics and the budgetary fallout from a highly politicized and deeply ideological Congress (and Executive branch) gets in the way of doing the right job. They fail to provide veridical information and the decision makers are hardly sapient enough to make veridical decisions even if they did (and sometimes they actually do!) The main tools for tactical management of the economy are science and data gathering. The guidance comes from the strategic plan to balance the human needs with the Ecos\' needs. We are a species almost with the ability to self-regulate our situation in the world. “Almost!” We are nearly sapient, but not nearly sapient enough to make it happen, it seems. Strategic Management The single most important variable in our strategic armamentarium is the population size relative to the free energy available for economic work. The amount of free energy is a function of technology as well as sources of raw energy (e.g. oil). This can be monitored by the tactical subsystem. The population size living at a standard able to support people achieving self actualization given the free energy available is the key to success of the human enterprise. Sapient strategic management means keeping track of the trend in the variables and setting plans for keeping everything in balance. Contrast this with the current notions of strategic management in state governments in the world. The only thing that approaches strategic management in scope is deciding which countries to invade or which trade relations are best for themselves. There is no real strategy for humanity. The United Nations just wants to keep the peace and try to keep up with refugee salvation. There is no real strategic plan for the globe as a whole even though we are all sharing this planet together. Even though the United States has attempted to take a global leadership role in advancing its ideological perspective (democracy, capitalism, and free markets) it has not had a coherent strategic plan — ever. Every new president and congress has had their own ideas about how to advance the notion that what is good for the US is good for the world, not many of the citizens of the world always agree. And the conflicting ideologies within the US polity can\'t advance and control a truly long-term agenda for achieving such a goal. A true strategic plan cannot come from a single country with its culturally derived ideologies, especially from one with deep schisms internally on what ideologies are valid. The only possible sapient strategic manager must necessarily have a global systemic perspective. Since everyone today is viewed as a citizen of some culture (country) or even of a specific ethnicity no one qualifies. It wouldn\'t matter how wise a person might be, in reality, as long as the general populations believe that countries are the natural organizing structures in the world, no one can gain legitimacy as a global leader. The president of the United States is the president of the United States and bound to protect the interests of that country even if it involves the detriment of other states, and, of course based on what is perceived as the validity of those interests. In the End... I have sought to make arguments for the notion that systems science has relevance for understanding the political economy; that in particular a hierarchical cybernetic system has relevance to the governance of an economic system that exists for the good of the human population without harming the Ecos. Hopefully you will see that, structurally speaking, the governance of the economy for the good of all is at least imaginable (also feasible). But, as I have tried to show, it is also dependent on the sapience of the decision agents who fill the roles of decision makers in that governance structure. And therein lay the rub. In theory a hierarchical cybernetic management governance is possible. We know this because it already has been demonstrated in nature. All successful complex adaptive systems show us that the hierarchical cybernetic subsystem is a necessary part of successful persistence (shall we call it sustainability). The reason is that the subsystem manages the internal economics of the larger system as well as its interactions with its own environment. And it implements a veridical strategic objective. The current governments of countries and the United Nations as a global management system are not hierarchical cybernetic systems even though they are attempting to tackle the issues of said management. As long as nationalism and regionalism (including exceptionalism) exist sapient governance cannot emerge. And as long as Homo sapiens persists these will continue. Sapient political economy is feasible in principle. But only if the agents within the system are themselves sapient. Is this even possible in the current species? I have doubts. Footnotes [1] OK. Full disclosure. I currently do live in what most would consider a McMansion! Its a long story but chalk it up to a lack of conviction when I was younger. Remember, wisdom (such as mine might be) is a function of age and learning. If I knew then what I know now I would have done things very differently back then. In my defence I do try to live wisely now. We keep the thermostat down in winter and do not use air conditioning. I ride a small motorcycle to work and we assiduously recycle! I speak from experience and lessons learned the hard way!

You can view Springer\'s catalog page at: http://www.springer.com/physics/complexity/book/978-1-4939-1919-2 This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. While the concepts and components of systems science will continue to be distributed throughout the various disciplines, undergraduate degree programs in systems science are also being developed, including at the authors’ own institutions. However, the subject is approached, systems science as a basis for understanding the components and drivers of phenomena at all scales should be viewed with the same importance as a traditional liberal arts education. Now on to my Sapience project!   Posted at 03:42 PM in Biophysical Economics, Books, Current Affairs, Education, Evolution, Political Economy, Sapience, Systems Science, The Human Condition | Permalink | Comments (6) August 12, 2014 What is Teaching? Instruction Not a small portion of my students complain bitterly when the fill out their student evaluations of the courses I teach. The typical complaint goes like this: He isn\'t organized. He frequently digresses into things that are not part of the subject and never tells us exactly what we are supposed to be learning. A more eye-opening version goes like this: He would not tell us what things were going to be on the test so we could focus on learning them. I felt totally unprepared for the exams. Sadly such comments are becoming more frequent in the last ten years. One of my pet peeves in education is the use of the term ‘instructor’ as a catch all for the person who is supposed to be teaching. Even dictionary.com blurs the distinction, essentially equating the two terms. And in vernacular usage people do not make much of a distinction. But if you consider the root of instructor, instruct, you get closer to the issue. To instruct means to give orders (British dictionary version) for how to do something. That is, an instructor gives instructions in the performance of a task. The term applies to, for example, flight instructors or combat instructors who give specific directions in algorithmic like sequences to people who have to learn a procedure. Such learning has little to do with the growth and development of the intellect. It is not intended to enhance thinking. Quite the opposite; it is intended to instill the procedure in tacit knowledge so that the performer doesn\'t have to think when doing. Contrast that to the idea that a human being should learn how to acquire concepts, to modify them in light of new information, to manipulate them in the mind to look at them from different perspectives, and, most important, to try combinations of concepts to see if something new, a meta-concept, emerges. In other words people need to be able to think. I had always believed that the objective of ‘higher’ education was to teach people to think. And not just higher education; I believed that the whole education enterprise should be dedicated to teach people both how to think and how to do things automatically that would support their success in thinking. For example, when learning mathematics you do need to be instructed in procedures but you also need to understand what those procedures are for in real life. Teaching should encompass both instruction in procedures, a process to guiding students to the information they will need, and challenging them to engage in thinking about concepts they construct in their minds. All of these processes are needed in order to teach students to become fully functional thinkers. What my complaining students were telling me is that they only wanted me to instruct them in the sense of how to prepare to take an examination. They were frustrated because their entire previous experience in education appeared to be this instructional process. People generally feel comfortable receiving instructions, following them, and then being assessed on their success in assimilating the instructions. And if their entire experience had been along these lines it would be understandable that not being instructed, while being expected to construct knowledge and understanding would be extremely stressful. But that is OK. We all need to learn how to deal with stress and we especially need to learn how to learn. Your boss will not be your instructor. That isn\'t her job. This last spring quarter I had some frank conversations with a few freshmen students who were in my core course on systems science. I asked them how they learned in high school, what did they have to do to succeed in their classes. I was prompted to do this because a large number of them claimed to have taken various science courses such as biology or chemistry (and claimed to have liked the subject), yet they could not answer very simple questions I would ask about those topics (I use a Socratic method style in lectures). They would say things like, “I remember we talked about that, but I don\'t remember exactly what it was.” How could someone take a course in biology in this day and age and not have learned something like the mechanisms at work in genetic transcription and translation for protein construction? This is so fundamental to understanding biology it seems incomprehensible that the schools are not teaching it. Yet the students proclaimed that it wasn\'t something that had been emphasized. I have one of my son\'s biology text from high school at home so I checked it out on the subject. Sure enough it is covered quite well. Any student who had actually studied this should have come away with a fairly good grasp of how the cell manufactures all its component parts. The same is true for metabolism. The book covered it well, but the students could barely remember what it was, what it did, or why. So on probing deeper what they told me was basically this. In school they are told what is going to be on the test, explicitly. That is they are told the nature of the questions they will be asked so that they can memorize little factoids from the text books. This is almost ritual and it applies most strongly to subjects that are related to the standardized high-stakes testing associated with No Child Left Behind or Race to the Top. However the practice appears to be wide-spread through many academic subjects. I could see why my students were complaining now. I would not tell them what was going to be on the test for several reasons. First I consider all of the subject to be relevant or I wouldn\'t have included it in the curriculum. But also, the tests I give are not the so-called (and terribly misnamed) objective exams. The latter is fine for testing the assimilation of specific facts and procedures. You can test someone\'s success at memorizing, for example, a mathematical procedure, like solving a quadratic equation, with such tests. There are right and wrong answers. But those kinds of tests do not assess how well the student can think. For lower-division courses I give exams that are a mix of fact/procedure learning and thinking using those facts and procedures. These students are new to the subjects and they need to build a lexicon of terms, simple relations, and procedures for things like solving problems and communications. But they also need to start getting used to displaying an ability to think about the subject. So at least 50% of the exams will be asking open-ended questions (short answer) for which there are good answers (i.e., putting ideas together in a logical way) but there are not purely right answers. Many, perhaps most of the students hate this. In upper division courses, especially electives, the situation changes and all of my exams and project assignments require a high degree of thinking. Generally most of the students have finally matured to a point that they can understand the reasons for this, though there are still a few who complain. There are probably several factors that contribute to the devolution of education to becoming essentially vocational-like instruction. Certainly the NCLB-type high stakes testing that has become the norm for so-called ‘accountability’ has reinforced the practice since the emphasis on passing the tests puts pressure on teachers as well as students. Their jobs are on the line. The whole system is pressed to performance as defined by objective measures, a significant proportion of students producing ‘right’ answers. But the tendency to rely on objective exams has been a feature of school education for a long time. Let\'s face it. Such exams are easy to prepare and grade. They only probe the surface of student learning and reduce the burden on teachers, especially considering the issue of class sizes. Since the measure of student success is the grade point average (GPA) and teachers surely want to see their students succeed, it is quite natural that they resort to teaching to the test. The pattern is widespread and deeply established in the hall of academia. Additionally the use of student evaluations of courses, by administrators desperate for a convenient “objective” measure of teaching effectiveness, again for accountability, produces a subtle pressure on teachers to ‘please’ the students. Their actions need not be the result of conscious decisions to do so. The effect comes through the subconscious bias that follows from basically understanding that their jobs could be on the line if the students aren\'t happy. In public higher education this effect is amplified by the issue of “retention”, or keeping students in school so that the graduation numbers look good. If you flunk out too many students or too many quit from frustration then you look bad and the social milieu will frown on you. Irony of Ironies Hardly a week goes by when I don\'t read a news item about how American education is failing to produce enough scientists and engineers. Many articles are about how schools are failing. The calls for reform are echoed from every corner of society. I talk directly to employers who are very vocal about how graduates they hire can\'t think. They can\'t communicate. They can\'t learn on their own. They might have good skills (say at programming), but cannot figure out how to analyse complex problems or design complex solutions. The louder the din is about how education is failing the more pressure there is to double down on accountability. And since the only thing most educators know how to do is focus on facts and procedures, that is where the effort will go. It will accomplish exactly the opposite of what is needed. More ironic still is the belief that somehow on-line education will solve these problems. I expect it to exacerbate the situation considerably. My own opinion is that on-line learning might work for, say, special topic courses, especially graduate level courses in professional fields. But to believe that whole baccalaureate programs can be delivered on-line and that the students will actually learn how to think in that subject is to be ignoring everything modern psychology of learning has to tell us about how people actually learn. The more our society panics about the failures of education the more they will do the exact wrong things. They want an inexpensive, quick solution to education reform. But the reality is that there is no magic bullet that can replace teachers who help students learn to think. It is inherently an expensive enterprise. Society invests in doing a good job so that it will benefit in the future when those graduates are active in the workforce and as citizens. But society has chosen to do the exact opposite. They want to find cheap ways which invariably rely on putting the burden (as well as the blame) on teachers. And that attitude will simply produce a much worse situation. I love my job. I love working with students who have finally gotten the fact that learning isn\'t the job of the teacher. I love being able to explore ideas such as I write about in these blogs. I love to exercise my intellect and challenge students to do the same. But there are parts of the job that are definitely unlovable! I do not like the whole process of assessment based on there being right and wrong answers. I do not like the grading system that only rewards successes and punishes failures when, in fact, most people learn more from failures than successes. I do not like having to be the bad guy who forces lower-division students to have to think when they have literally been trained to not do so. But I accept these negative parts and the responsibility for being accountable to their long-term interests even as they see me as their enemy. It goes with the job. Every once in awhile I get a communique from a former student who has been out in the world for a while. And those communiques make it all worthwhile. A not atypical message will say something to the effect: I have to confess when I took your course I really hated it. But I have found out that you were really right about learning to think. I started practising what you said and today I am a chief designer for my company. Just wanted to say thanks. And also apologize for giving you low scores on the student evals. Teaching isn\'t (just) training. It is a whole constellation of guidance skills. But mostly it has to be about getting students to think well. It has become a steep uphill battle in recent years thanks to society\'s penchant for cheap and fast preparation for specialist jobs being the basis for education. I\'m just glad I got to work in the field while there was still some semblance of rationality abiding. I just feel sorry for the masses who are moving inexorably toward deep ignorance as a result of being educated in the US. Posted at 12:56 PM in Current Affairs, Education, Political Economy, The Human Condition | Permalink | Comments (7) August 08, 2014 Governance of an Economy An Example from Biology A living system is the basic example of an economy. For example within a single cell the metabolic machinery is a production factory to produce more biomass, either growth of the cell to a mature size, or through cell division production of new individuals. There is a third product that some cells, those in multicellular organisms, make and that is simply replacement of degraded biomass, what we call a steady-state economy. Figure 1 shows a simplified and abstract representation of cell metabolism, at least as far as things like protein synthesis and uses are concerned. The major work processes are the construction of enzymes (and enzymatic systems) and the machinery construction. Various processes, such as those shown, are actually complex molecular machines that require enzymes and energy to do their work. For example the ribosomes, the major protein synthesizer machine has to be constructed out of RNA molecules and proteins. All of the cellular organelle are constructed or self-organize based on their inherent chemistries. The cell is basically an “exchange” economy where various machines produce products needed by other machines. Most often the trades go through several steps. In the background all of the machines tend to degrade and break down. Their molecules have to be either recycled or expelled. Many cells actually produce molecular products that are used by other cells, so the exchange model extends to whole multicellular systems as well.   Figure 1. Metabolism in a living cell is an example of an economic system.   Every cell captures materials and energy from its environment. Photosynthesizing cells (plants) have an energy capture and conversion machine, the chloroplast, that manufactures energy packets, like adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) from sunlight input. Animal and fungal cells take in molecules that are both energy carriers and raw materials. They first need to digest organic materials (from plants) and then machines called mitochondria convert the carbohydrates into ATP. ATP is like a floating battery that circulates everywhere within the cell conveying convenient energy to all of the other machines. Every machine in the cell (organelles) use the energy stored in ATP to do their work. All of them employ proteins and membranes. The former can be either structural components or functional (enzymes). The latter, bi-layered lipoproteins, encapsulate the functions of the machines. Those boundary conditions regulate the flows of molecules so that rates of work are controlled. Every machine, or metabolic processor, operates under feedback control. Certain molecules “sense” the products and provide either direct feedback to the machine (e.g. down modulating the production of certain proteins at the ribosomes) or escort the products off to the recycling center if they are not needed. Some escorts test the quality of the output, for example determine when a protein has not folded into its tertiary structure properly, and acting as quality control monitors send the deformed product off for digestion and recycling. Living economies operate under fairly rigid rules (principles) with respect to the conservation of material and energy. For example the rule of “if you don\'t use it, you lose it” is followed rigidly. Cells don\'t keep useless organelles or molecules around if they are not actively contributing to the whole system. Such “excesses” are degraded and digested, recycled or expelled. And their production machinery will be down-modulated. No more energy will be expended on producing what isn\'t needed. Another rule is: “If there is a greater need to produce product X, then up-modulate the machinery to make it.” When cells are placed under conditions that are unfavorable, where some critical factor like pH is near or beyond the limits of tolerance the cell responds by up regulating machinery that produces mechanisms to thwart or compensate it. These rules reflect the laws of supply and demand. The depiction in figure 1 represents the kind of organization and processes that take place in the cytoplasm outside of the nucleus. The basic controls regulating metabolism are operational controls (as covered in the last post). Everything is tightly coupled through feedback loops and under “nominal” conditions the market of exchanges and valuation based on energy consumption works cooperatively without a great deal of intervention. But nominal conditions hardly prevail for long. Every cell sits in an environment where fluctuation in critical factors constantly impose stresses that must be responded to, as described above. One of life\'s earliest accomplishments was the invention of homeostasis. This is the basic feedback control loop for maintaining critical factors within a nominal range by reacting to external changes. A homeostatic mechanism can either do something actively to influence the external conditions, or respond by activating a movement of the organism away from the situation (where movement is possible) or call upon internal reserve mechanisms to counter the external influence, for example by sequestering molecules when their concentrations are driven too high. Homeostasis is the first level of tactical management, coordination with the external world in order to maintain function. It also demonstrates the tight link between operational control and tactical control. Figure 2 depicts the components of a homeostatic system.   Figure 2. Homeostasis.   The basic physiological process depicted could be any of the producing machines described above. It needs and input of some critical factor to do its job. But the critical factor is influenced by something in the environment that can drive that factor above or below its necessary level. The control system monitors the input generating a feed forward error signal, eff, which is used by the sub-process I\'ve called the ‘control model’ to generate a control signal, cr that activates the response mechanism. That mechanism is capable of doing something that counteracts the environmental influence. This diagram shows an arrow from the response to the environmental factor, but the mechanism might act internally, for example to actively sequester or neutralize unwanted molecules. The control model might be a complex one. I\'ve included the basic feedback control loop for the physiological process product output. The comparator generates an error signal, efb, that can be used by the model to send a control signal, cp to the process to take internal corrective action. The model, thus, represents a close cooperation between an operational control (feedback) and a simple tactical control (feed forward). Also shown in the figure is a depiction of a higher-order mechanism that embodies the two principles mentioned above. The response mechanism needs to be maintained at some level of readiness that is just necessary for the ordinary sorts of responses it has to make. The ‘response constructor’ is responsible for this maintenance. Imagine its “responsiveness” as represented by the size of the oval. It can\'t be too big because its maintenance would be prohibitive in terms of energy and material required. At the same time it cannot be too small because if the external influence were to drive the critical factor out of range too fast it would result in some kind of damage to the organism that could be fatal. How to determine what the right size would be? The response constructor uses some kind of molecular memory device that keeps, essentially, a time averaged trace of the history of external influences (supplied by the control model). If the memory value is high then it means the influence has been strong and frequent over some past time window. Thus the response constructor “knows” to build up and keep strong the response mechanism. It will invest more material and energy into the response mechanism because it “expects” there will be an on-going need for fast and strong responses in the future. The details of the constructor and its memory are not important right now. I will just say that this basic kind of machinery is active in all biological systems where some anticipation of future demands for a function is needed to prevent damage or take advantage of an opportunity. In a more elaborate and multi-time domain form, this is the basis for what neurons do when they encode memory traces in their synapses. Hence the term memory is not abused here. You may recognize the above figure as it is basically the same as figure 6 in the prior post in this series. Here I have added the response constructor to expand the example as an exchange economic model. In the metabolic economy there is a true ‘currency.’ That currency is the packets of energy called ATP. Energy is involved in all transactions and, by the second law of thermodynamics, degrades in capacity to drive work as it flows through the economy. It is given off as waste heat and new high grade energy must always be supplied. The messages depicted in these figures are conveyed by chemical signaling. Small weight molecules are released by one sub-process and diffuse through the cytosol to be ‘received’ by another, target, sub-process that will then act on that message. Cells have receptor sites on the outsides of their membranes that are specialize to couple with these diffusing molecules. When that happens it generally sets off a cascade of so-called second messengers that eventually affect an internal control mechanism that then does its work (having access to ubiquitous ATP) and responds to the signal the cell received. That is what is actually going on in figure 2 with all of the signal arrows representing various molecules that activate the machinery, such as the response mechanism. Chemical signaling was the earliest form of communications in living systems, both internal and external to the cell membrane. But the point is that the cellular metabolic economy is regulated by the same hierarchical control system covered in the last post. When we include the role of the genes, along with their network of expression controls and epigenetic mechanisms, we will find that it all fits the model shown in figure 8 in that post. There is one more aspect to the biological model of economy governance that should be brought out. Cells do not grow bigger and bigger forever. There are constraints on how large a cell of a particular type can get to be. Some constraints may be imposed by external factors, others, like effectiveness of heat dissipation, may be imposed by internal factors. Newly created cells, however, are smaller than the optimal size and so they follow the mandate to convert materials and energy in to new biomass within their membrane. Once they reach the optimal size however they have the potential to replicate by cellular division, thus making two small cells that then, each, continue to grow biomass. They do this as long as there are no external constraints, such as lack of a vital material or energy, to cause them to stop growing and simply maintain. In the case of multicellular organisms the same pattern can be seen but with an interesting twist. External factors, that is external to the multi-celled tissue that is growing, can trigger internal signaling within the tissue to stop the reproduction of more cells. This is what happens, for example, in the development of organ tissues in embryos and fetuses. Cells receive signals that not only tell them what to differentiate into, but also when to cease growth activity or at least modulate it to fit with the overall organism growth pattern. No one tissue can exceed its natural size. Figure 3 depicts this form of restraint on growth.   Figure 3. The biological mandate dictates that more biomass be produced until some forms of constraint trigger restraint.   Biological systems evolved these self-restraint in the face of external constraints in order to preserve life. Any overrun by any one biological entity threatens the life of all other organisms and therefore mechanisms for suspending the biological mandate were needed to achieve balance in the whole ecosystem. The regulation mechanisms are many in form but you will find them at all levels of living systems. And you can see the effects when they fail to work. This is what cancer is, a breakdown in the growth-regulating system releases the suspension on the mandate and the cells resume growth and reproductions indiscriminately. I\'ll return to this idea later. The Biophysical Economy The human economic system is effectively the same model as the cellular metabolic economy. The roles of materials and energy are the same. The work processes needed to construct products needed by other processes are basically the same. Even the purpose of the whole system is the biological mandate of growing more human biomass. In figure 4 I have drawn yet another view of the biophysical economy, abstracting all of the basic functions into just a few representative sub-processes. Fundamentally the economy is designed to extract natural resources from the Ecos as well as capture sources of energy to then produce all of the goods and services that ultimately go to consumers through a distribution subsystem. If you trace through the flows and processes you will see that this schema is similar to what was shown in figure 1. Unlike the cell example the human economy has a much smaller recycling capability (so it is not shown).   Figure 4. The biophysical economy is shown in a very abstracted form.   Since I have written a considerable amount about the biophysical economy (and biophysical economics) I won\'t go into details here (look for more in the Biophysical Economics section of the blog). Rather I want to call attention to the signal arrows in this figure, the thin black and green arrows. These are the cooperation signals the provide supply and demand messages between processes. In the past I have claimed that money is really just a form of signal, information about the amount of usable (free) energy that can be controlled in the sense of directing which work is to be done (see figure 5 below). Unfortunately in a debt-based situation such as we have today money is a very distorted message conveyance. That is one reason that our current economic system, world wide, is not working very well. The governance model (essentially free markets with light regulations on selected processes) relies too heavily on cooperation and that depends on the fidelity of inter-process signals. As already argued, when any system gets too complex it is necessary to introduce coordination (logistical management) between processes in order to facilitate the functions in figure 4.   Figure 5. Money is used to convey information regarding the flows of goods and services. Individual agents decide how much money (the intensity of the message!) to send. The receiver interprets the message to determine how much work to do and thus how much energy to expend.   What this really means is that a workable governance model must be based on effective communications and realistic logistics rules. The governance we have was born from a very nebulous set of ideas about the interactions between government, political process, and the economy, hence the name political economy. The system is a result of an evolutionary process but with a kind of built-in bias toward the idea of progress. Unlike all previous forms of social evolution (e.g. emergence of eukaryotic cells from bacterial cells, emergence of multicellularity, etc.) the evolution of the political economy has been nudged along by the reflective agents who have tried to shape what it would be. It was as if certain genes in the genome ‘thought’ about what they wanted and mutated themselves accordingly. The whole system is impacted by ideology-based decisions, and generally not for the better. Overlay the complexification of society due to technological development and you have the evolution not of a sustainable system, but an aggregate of many dysfunctional processes. Economic Governance Consider the history of economic systems that have come into existence since the advent of agriculture. The original governance of agriculture-based societies was based on the need to reliably produce food stuffs for the society. Governance began with the specialization of those who could see the larger picture, not just how to plant seeds, but when and where to plant. The early Egyptians, for example, organized around the management of water from the Nile river and the land immediately nearby. A coordination function emerged quite early in the form of early kings (probably derived from “headmen” in nomadic tribes) in neighboring territories who took on the role by managing the administration of things like granaries and the emergent functions of ‘surveyors’ who specialized in measuring out the land areas after the annual Nile floods had receded. After the invention of the plow and the domestication of animals, along with the increasing capabilities to work with metals and clay, specialist trades developed rapidly. The production of products of these specialists needed to be organized and coordinated since any one specialist might be losing track of what the others were doing. Someone had to rise above the whole operation and help make sure what needed to be done was done. The model of governance that emerged in Egypt and five other similar civilization centers was based on a hierarchy of command and control. The kings became Pharaohs, god-kings, who had absolute authority. They presumed their knowledge was absolute. As the complexity of the kingdom rose layers of administrators were rapidly added. The Pharaoh became more distant from the workers in the fields. A class system based on the tendency in human psychology to establish some kind of pecking order was amplified by the nature of the hierarchy. This would establish a pattern that would be with us for the rest of our experience. A human bureaucracy superposed over the natural management hierarchy carried all of the flaws of human psyche, especially the lack of adequate sapience to counteract the limbic system\'s tendency to drive the need for establishing power relations. It has never been a particularly happy combination. Among the duties of the ruling class, by virtue of their nominal positions, was the protection of land holdings — the territory of the kingdom. A separate specialization developed early on, that of the warrior and the armed forces necessary to protect the kingdom from marauders. At first their jobs were probably mainly defensive but as time went on and kingdoms experienced bad harvest from time to time, the idea of invading another territory probably followed very naturally. Of course it might not have taken a hard time to promote the notion of aggression. Humans are already individually aggressive and greedy (again a lack of sapience thing). So the temptation to invade another kingdom for booty or outright takeover was probably not a hard hurdle to jump. The basic form of hierarchical governance with class and power overlays has been with us ever since. Even the American and European experiments in some forms of democracy have not been able to rid us entirely of this structure. For example the American presidency, which George Washington explicitly demanded not be like a king, has evolved to a king-like status. We even have a modern form of dynasty in families like the Roosevelts, the Bushes, and the Clintons. The British, of course, never got rid of their royalty, going back to feudal days. What is wrong with governance is the humans who implement it. A human being is a selfish, self-centered, limited-perspective agent who is placed in the untenable position of making cybernetic decisions with weak knowledge and distorted senses. No mere mortal man (or woman) can be the president of the United States, or leader of any state on the planet. The philosopher kings are rare these days. Human Agents Recall figure 4 in the prior post, reproduced here so you don\'t have to go back to that. We human beings are, ourselves hierarchical cybernetic systems. Our brains are designed to process operational level, coordination level and strategic level information. We make decisions at all of these levels. But, and this is a huge caveat, we are driven by the biological mandate and our sapience capacity is still very immature. In figure 6 I\'ve added the limbic system that drives much of human decision making. In higher sapience the feedback from the strategic level of decision making acts to down modulate the emotional and purely biological drives that influence our thinking and reactions. In ordinary sapience (i.e. the average brain) this feedback is weak and the influences from the limbic system will ultimately dominate decision. This is the basic reason that economic agents are selfish and mostly irrational.   Figure 6. The irrational and selfish agent is motivated by limbic drives and desires.   Human beings are the worst agents for a hierarchical cybernetic system since the inject their own desires into the decision process. Moreover they are largely plagued by incomplete or even wrong knowledge about how the world works. Libertarians are the worst. They completely deny the need for a regulation system. But I have to admit that their instincts might be right given that it is human agents that are doing the regulation. A political economy needs a hierarchical cybernetic framework. What it does not need is human decision makers who are so lacking in sapience. But suppose that the agents in a hierarchical cybernetic system could be more sapient. In effect it would mean an expanded strategic thinking ability along with expanded systems and higher-order judgment ability. Such an agent would not have lost their limbic drives; evolution doesn\'t work that way. Instead what the expansion of the prefrontal cortex associated with increased sapience would mean is a stronger ability to down-modulate the activities of the limbic system that might have driven poor, selfish decisions. Such individuals would have stronger cooperativity motivation and more empathetic capacity; they would be hyper-social creatures. In short, they would be wise. Figure 7 depicts such an agent. I call such an agent an “adaptive, evolvable agent” because their expanded abilities include being able to deal with uncertainty, ambiguity, and especially an ability to modify their own concepts (beliefs) in light of new evidence. Their thinking is capable of evolving with changing conditions.   Figure 7. An adaptive, evolvable agent is one with greater sapience than we currently see in most people. Greater sapience would include expanding on strategic thinking in each agent, but would also mean the agent would be hyper-social, quite ready and motivated to cooperate with fellow agents.   In my next post in this series I will attempt to construct a hierarchical cybernetic system for a human economy that would be long-term stable (dare I say sustainable?) Note that I said \'a\' human economy. Given the situation with energy source depletion it cannot be the current economy. I\'ll base the design on the above concepts of a biophysical economy embedded within the Ecos framework and in balance with it. We can then ask, what governance might look like for such a system. We have to use my adaptive, evolvable agents as the decision makers in this structure, and I will offer the argument as to why this is so. Granted that this is something like a Platonic ideal — we don\'t have a surfeit of highly sapient people to work with — but in order to understand where our real system is it might be useful to gauge against what the ideal might look like.

I was born on this day in 1945 and am always reminded of the fact. But more than that, the thought that I came into this world on the very day of the greatest terrorism act against civilians of all time (along with Nagasaki just a few days later) has been a driving force pushing me to find meaning in life. The current rhetoric, especially in the US, regarding the terrorism going on in the Middle East (particularly between Israel and Hamas) is just so empty. How was it possible for the US to bomb innocent civilians in one war and then call out anyone else who does the same thing is totally beyond my comprehension - except that I chalk it up to the meaning I have found, human beings, as a species, are really not sapient. Please remember. On another, happier note: my textbook, \"Princples of Systems Science\", is being typset as we speak! Still on track for autumn 2014! George   Posted at 10:29 AM in Biophysical Economics, Current Affairs, Evolution, Political Economy, Sapience, Systems Science, The Human Condition | Permalink | Comments (2) July 31, 2014 Systems Science and the Political Economy The Fundamentals of Economics I\'d like to examine the political economy from the perspective of systems science. Specifically I want to put biophysical economics together with the theory of hierarchical cybernetic systems to see if we can\'t find some guidance to developing a model of a well regulated, functional, and maintainable economic system. Political economy is the study of the intersection between the system of governance and the economic system that supports those participating in the society. There are quite a few political theories regarding this intersection, from strict forms of socialism to anarchy (no governance) wherein the free markets will self-regulate. But these political theories are inevitably based on ideological frameworks. In the end they are supported not by evidence or even logic, but by emotions and “gut feelings.” Here I want to do an analysis of a biophysical economic system, i.e. one based on the scientific realities of energy, work, wealth, and the laws of thermodynamics, that asks what might we find as scientifically based models of regulation that, in particular, keep the system in balance with the Ecos and maintained over an indefinite period of time. My analysis begins with the fundamental components of any economic system, the individuals that participate in a social contract involving specialization of work skills and trades of wealth. One might be tempted to think of this as the ultimate microeconomic framework. To be clear, economics involves the control of behaviors that contribute to the obtaining of resources needed to maintain a biological system, including those needed to extend the system into the future, e.g. reproduction. The biological mandate to continue to exist and reproduce is paramount. Every human being is bound by this mandate and all economic decisions are subject to its dictates. In spite of all the seeming complexity and sophistication of human behavior, ultimately it is all directed at fulfilling this mandate. We can more easily see this by looking at human evolution. What were we when we evolved to our current form? What were our behaviors as creatures of nature? The exposure of our basic biological heritage can be gleaned from this background. Figure 1, below, depicts this unit of economic activity, an individual. I\'ve chosen to start with an individual from a pre-agriculture time to show how this is basically a biological entity. Energy flows from the sun to plants and from there to animals and humans (some via animal protein). Humans can then do physical work using resources from nature to produce various tools, such as stone cutters and scrapers, wooden digging sticks, and clothing, that all give the human leverage in obtaining the natural resources.   Figure 1. Early Homo sapiens obtained life support through hunting and gathering getting energy from plants and animals. Human labor, in the form of fashioning useful tools allowed humans to more efficiently obtain the energy, which was a major evolutionary advantage.   By contrast consider the modern state of affairs. Each individual human is now amplified in their work capacity by the burning of fossil fuels for 80%+ of their high-power work needs. Figure 2 depicts this situation. Humans, by virtue of producing power tools can do considerably more work than they could by hand. So they produce more product (or service) per unit of time and wealth (the aggregate of products and services) accumulates. Some of those power tools increase the human effort efficiency (not necessarily the work efficiency), which is called “productivity”, a seemingly good thing. When humans were few in numbers, even after having mastered water and animal power to improve their productivity, there seemed to be enough energy and material resources so that the economic activity of individuals could expand giving rise to accumulation of wealth. Surely that was a good thing!   Figure 2. The use of external high-power fuels to drive automation amplifies the human capacity for work many fold. The individual unit as depicted in figure 2 will be the one we will use later. Returning to the early human situation, consider figure 3 below. This is the fundamental unit of social economics. The basic idea was recognized by Adam Smith as the inherent capacity for certain individuals to become specialized in one kind of work wherein they are very efficient. The products so produced, however, have wider appeal and so two (or more) individuals producing excesses over their own needs may enter into a trade relation in which they negotiate an exchange based on some perceived relative value per unit of their products. That is they barter.   Figure 3. A simple model of specialization and trade. One human produces product A and needs or wants product B. The reverse is the case for the second individual. They negotiate a trade on the basis of some perceived unit value of each product.   Incorporated into figure 3 is the now more prominent material resources such as wood and fiber as well as rocks and, later, bronze metal. The situation represents, roughly, the transition period from the Paleolithic to the early Bronze Age. Humans were in the process of mastering building and shaping arts, becoming proficient in agriculture and animal husbandry, and engaged in trade on an inter-individual and inter-group basis. The figure shows the flows of matter, energy, and influence (messages). Each individual human is responsible for applying control to the work process (e.g. farming, making tools, etc.) The cybernetic element in this model is the individual, an adaptive agent capable of making hierarchical cybernetic decisions and learning to change economic behaviors based on experience in various situations. Economic Agents Every human individual must make a range of decisions that guide their economic behavior. These range from purely operational level decisions (plant the seeds in this plot of land), to logistic (save enough seed from this harvest to plant next year), to tactical (obtain some new seeds from the tribe over the hill) to strategic (find a way to expand my territory). The individual agent thus embodies the whole hierarchy of cybernetic management with respect to their own individual behaviors. Some individuals were particularly good at different levels in this hierarchy. Some (a few) particularly good at strategic and tactical thinking were able to organize the activities of many members of a social unit. We will examine this tendency later. In figure 4 I have provided a simple representation of an adaptive agent that will be developed as the fundamental economic agent. Bear in mind that all that motivates this agent is the biological mandate. Ultimately all decisions are directed toward maintenance and reproduction. But because the agent is adaptive and also under the mandate to maintain life at the least cost, it will find creative ways to accomplish its mission with the least risk while conserving energy.   Figure 4. An economic agent (an individual) is modeled as a decision maker with an ability to consider operational, tactical, logistical, and strategic decisions. The human brain is a hierarchical cybernetic system that evolved in response to the increasingly complex world it had to survive in.   Things Get Complicated I will start with a refresher on hierarchical cybernetics as realized in the human brain (the agent) and with examples form meta-biological social systems, especially commercial enterprises. All humans do some kind of work and produce things that they and others can use in carrying out the biological mandate. Figure 5 shows a work process in which an operational-level controller maintains the quality of the product through a feedback loop. If the product being produced gets out of specs, the operator (agent) generates a control signal or action that brings the product quality back into alignment with the desired values. Those values are, of course, determined by what the “customer” wants.   Figure 5. Work processes produce a product that is desired by a customer. The quality and quantity of the product requires close monitoring by the operational level management of the human agent.   The next higher level in the cybernetic hierarchy is the coordination level. Figure 6 shows the agent performing both feedback and feed forward control. The coordination level serves two basic purposes. The first is to coordinate the behaviors of some number of internal sub-processes within the basic work process (shown later). The second is to coordinate the overall behavior of the work process with the external environment, in particular, the sources of inputs and the sinks for outputs. In this figure I show a simple version of a coordination level controller using the beginnings of a tactical (pre-tactical) model and feed forward information from the input flows to send commands to the work process in order to modulate the input flows appropriately, for example by using internal buffers to store excess in times of plenty and supply internal sub-processes in times of want.   Figure 6. Coordination with the external world begins by monitoring the input flows against their desired values and modulating them to be within the desired ranges.   Logistical control handles coordination between internal sub-processes when a work process is complex. It is broken up into sub-processes, each of which has its own operational control and an overseer logistical controller.   Figure 7. Coordination of internal sub-processes involves logistical controls. The controller receives messages from the operational level controllers regarding time-averaged behaviors of the processes. It uses a balancing or optimization model to determine the best mix of operational control settings so that all of the sub-processes operate in synchrony (harmony).   In many situations (many different kinds of systems) the logistical control is somewhat automatic, requiring little in the way of “conscious” decision making; this is the case for the human brain, for example. Most of the regulation of internal subsystems is under non-conscious control, e.g. heart rate and breathing when exercising. In most large organizations (e.g. corporations) the routine procedures that are followed (codified in procedures manuals) are similarly automatic and senior management does not concern itself with the details of middle management\'s work until the profit and cost center numbers come in, say, at the end of the month. Even then they do not worry about the details but rather just reward or punish performance. When a complex system is operating in a complex environment the demands on tactical control are great. The system must advance from merely checking flows in and out, but must actually have more information about the sources and sinks themselves. From the pre-tactical coordination to a fully tactical form we need new kinds of message processing that collects data from the external world and provides this to a full tactical controller. Whereas pre-tactical involves relatively simple real-time sensing, the tactical controller works over much longer time scales relative to the operations. It includes anticipatory models of the environment that can be used to predict future behaviors that could lead to variations in the resource inflows or customer demands, etc. Figure 8 depicts this situation.   Figure 8. A full tactical controller (evolved from the workings of the pre-tactical version) is able to sense the behaviors of external entities of importance to the system and use models of those behaviors to anticipate the near future, thus being able to devise tactical moves to minimize negative impacts or maximize positive ones for the whole system. The tactical and logistical controllers still need to communicate with one another to provide complete coordination, within and without.   Once again, the human brain is a wonderful example of this capacity. Our external sensory system is constantly taking in data about the state of the world while we are not sleeping (or daydreaming). It processes this data into percepts based on our memory system\'s images, which, in turn, feed into the concept processing areas of the brain. We are continually processing lower-level concepts, e.g. there is a wall in front of me, which we have learned to handle without much conscious attention (turn to avoid the wall). Our interactions with our social world takes much more processing and not a small amount of conscious attention since people are generally always surprising us to some degree or another. We have to have models of them to help us react to or anticipate their behaviors. Many brain scientists think this is the basis for the evolution of our larger brains, that our social interactions are so much more complex than those of our nearest relatives (apes) that we need much more processing capacity to interact tactically with other people. Organizations, too, invest considerably into tactical coordination. The purchasing department, the sales department (with marketing), the shipping department, etc. are all examples of complex operations that deal with the external environment, attempting to maximize benefits to the organization (get the best price). Marketing departments in particular are a lot like the social tactical facilities in the brain (and this is actually not just an analogy) representing some very conscious considerations with respect to getting customers to want the products and be willing to pay good money to get them. Tactical decisions are about how to win the battle; they are relatively short-term in scope. But decisions about which wars to wage, that is strategic, longer-term, and involving the likely changing of behaviors to achieve a strategic opportunity or avoid a threat. For this a new level of cybernetic management is needed that can process long-term plans and direct modifications to the internal structure or tactical models such that behaviors of the system change to accommodate long-term changes in the environment. This involves extending the time horizon and scope of the world models associated with tactical control. The new level is strategic/planning. Figure 9 depicts the larger scope of strategic control. The strategic decision maker is receiving information from the tactical (and logistical) controllers but also receives information from the larger world, those entities with which it might not have direct interactions (clouds), but whose behaviors might impact the sources and sinks with which the system does interact (e.g., influence arrows from clouds to sources). This is more than just tactical control; it evolves from tactical control when the larger environment is highly dynamic, complex (e.g., bi-directional arrows between clouds), and non-stationary giving rise to a need to understand how the future will shape up in order to avoid new dangers and exploit new opportunities. Not shown in the figure, the strategic controller has the ability to “pre-adapt” functions and processes within the system such that new behaviors can emerge to make the system more competent in the future state of the world. The strategic control is responsible for long-term planning based on its best estimate of what that future world will be like.   Figure 9. Strategic control obtains information not just from the tactical level (based on the behaviors of sources and sinks) but also from other factors in the environment that may impact those sources and sinks. It looks at general models of these factors to try and set plans for changes the system need to make internally to take advantage of opportunities and avoid threats in the long-run.   Certain areas of the prefrontal cortex in the human brain perform this function. Most human beings do have a limited capacity to think about the future and lay plans. The brain certainly has the capacity to learn about the behaviors of other entities in the world that do not have a direct influence on the individual, but are part of a larger stochastic dynamic that could come to have an impact. The brain does have the ability to do some limited strategic planning and control, but whether the majority of people fully use this facility is an open question. Organizations, similarly, have a strategic thinking function and tend to try to use it explicitly. However, because these functions are carried out by people, the true efficacy of such functions is subject to how well the individuals think strategically. One key difference between strategic and tactical control involves the capacity of the system to make alterations to its sub-processes or even gain new sub-processes that will be used in the future. Human beings cannot do much to change their individual selves, for example they cannot ‘learn’ to digest a poisonous plant that might become food. Biological evolution is needed to alter physiological and physical aspects of the body. Humans can adapt within narrow ranges of tolerance to changing environments, but not change their fundamental ways of interacting with the environment. They can, however, change their tactical models, or in other words, learn to behave differently with respect to the world. For example, humans learned to construct and wear clothing to increase their tolerance to cold conditions, something necessary during the periods of glaciation in Europe and Asia. This was not a strategic decision but a tactical move that had strategic consequences for individuals and for the species. The only internal sub-processes that humans can alter or acquire are concepts encoded in engrams in the brain. Strategic decisions generally involve changing sub-processes, so an example of a strategic decision would be when deciding on what in the world should be attended to and be a source of learning. For example, when someone thinks about what career they would like to pursue they are making decisions that will result in changing their own brains (the engrams) one way as opposed to another. Organizations, on the other hand, have tremendous ‘morphing’ abilities (called evolvability). They can alter, gain, or discard sub-processes at will (of the strategic thinker) providing they have the resources (i.e. financial) to do so. An organization\'s behavior can be radically altered in the sense that it becomes capable of doing something entirely new vis-á-vis its tactics and logistics. But organizations are limited by the cognitive capabilities of their strategic managers (CEOs). Unless they possess real vision and knowledge of the world, they may not be able to take advantage of their evolvability. Most organizations change as a result of experimentation and muddling through rather than planning and executing. It is tempting to wonder what might happen if an organization actually did do a good job of strategic planning and execution. I think there are a few examples in history, but since those successes depended on visionary individuals, after they retired or moved on, the organization generally fell back into the muddling mode. The Trouble with Markets Really complex systems, those with many various kinds of sub-processes that must work together to be successful in a complex environment, require a cybernetic hierarchy in order to do so. One of the reasons this is so is that inevitably communications break down between more distant sub-processes when the information must be relayed across many such intervening sub-processes as is the case in a highly connected but sparse network such as depicted in figure 10. Here all nodes, representing sub-processes, are fully connected through interactions (abstractly represented by links between nodes). Any behavior changes in any one of the sub-processes can be propagated throughout the network eventually impacting all the other nodes and probably with reverberating effects at that.   Figure 10. In a network of interactions, even if sparsely connected, the propagation of effect due to one node may affect every other node.   There will be time delays inherent in the system since it takes time for information to propagate. Add to this the notion that active (thinking and deciding) agents can exert local control over how and when (or even whether) the process can propagate the information to other nodes and you have the potential for the introduction of noise and distortions. The results can be disastrous when time delays and positive feedback loops (amplification) are involved. It turns out that markets are really like this situation. Markets are systems in which aggregates of agents transact (trade) through links. Such transactions can be simple exchanges such as barter or more complex, involving tokens of value that are exchanged along with the movement of goods or performance of services. When markets as systems are relatively simple, e.g. the outdoor markets where food and trinkets are traded the possibility for establishing connections between agents for the purpose of establishing the relative value of what is being traded makes it possible for the market to establish consensus values in the form of fair prices. Each seller knows what effort and costs went into the production of their products and each buyer can attempt to keep the sellers as close to those costs, i.e. not expect to make a huge profit at the buyer\'s expense. Through the jostling of buyers and sellers haggling the magic of a market mechanism for setting prices is pretty much what Adam Smith described in Wealth of Nations. Unfortunately as trades become more complex, for example involving transporters and middlemen, as the separation between buyers and sellers increases in time and space, as products and services become more complex and specialized, the information flow needed to allow that magic to work is increasingly subject to distortions (including false or misleading information). Prices fail to reflect any real costs (plus fair profit) and the system becomes vulnerable to crashes and bubbles — exactly what we see in the modern world. Even though libertarian ideologues clutch onto their cherished Randian notion that the market is the best mechanism for establishing prices and, through competition, generate greater goods and services, systems science shows us this is not the case. Market mechanisms are good for small-scale and simple systems. But as the system becomes much more complex they are incapable of providing the needed information flow to ensure all sub-systems are working optimally. Throughout the history of life on Earth, from its origins to the present time, nature\'s answer to emerging complexity has been the same over and over. At a certain point in a system\'s evolution, hierarchical control evolves so as to stabilize and maintain the system. If it does not, the system fails to survive and therefore cannot compete against those that do. The latter are the survivors (and replicators) and live on to undergo further evolution and participate in further complexification. Societies and their economic systems are no different. Governments have always developed ways to regulate flows in systems through various supra-economic mechanisms (e.g. taxes and policies). They are (usually) unwittingly carrying out the natural emergence of hierarchical control, albeit messily. Evolution does not work by producing perfect systems, in the sense of engineering for a purpose. It experiments. It is a massively parallel search through a possibility space of options and only some of them work. The history of humanity is full of multiple attempts to find some mechanisms of regulation (operational, coordinational, and strategic) that suit their societies given the technologies and beliefs held by those societies. None of the societies to date have gotten the formula right and that definitely includes the western democracies. The combination of republican governance (i.e. representative democracy with evolving inclusiveness) and capitalism, along with, as it turns out, foolish beliefs in the role of greed and profit taking, were bolstered in the late 19th centuries by the unprecedented influx of high power energy in the form of fossil fuels that were abundant and relatively easy to extract. These interacting aspects reinforced one another to produce copious material goods and services, what I would call ersatz wealth. Those agents who benefited most from this explosion of production naturally looked upon the ideologies behind the aspects and concluded that it was good to let capitalism and free markets flourish in a society of free individuals. They didn\'t think twice about the role of energy, so distanced were they from the realities of existence (Figure 1) that it never occurred to them that wealth was not a product of capitalism and free markets, but in reality a product of energy flow. It wasn\'t until the latter half of the 20th century that some people started questioning this situation. What would happen when the finite resources of fossil fuels became depleted? The modern meme holds that technology will figure out a replacement. In my next post in this series I will address the issues involved in designing an intentional political economy based on hierarchical cybernetics and biophysical principles. Where this goes involves recognizing that the biological mandate, as described earlier, must be regulated in such a way that agents can be free to act in manners that maximize their well-being but also do not jeopardize the well-being of the society (indeed the species). It is hard to imagine that a governance system comprised of human agents, with their faults and foibles and also driven by the biological mandate, could achieve the right combination of benign oversight and non-coercive regulations needed for the complexity of modern human societies. But it seems a worthy challenge to me to at least ask the questions.

Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. The subject of systems science, as a basis for understanding the components and drivers of phenomena at all scales, should be viewed with the same importance as a traditional liberal arts education. Principles of Systems Science contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. It ends with practical aspects such as systems analysis, computer modeling, and systems engineering that demonstrate how the knowledge of systems can be used to solve problems in the real world.  Each chapter is broken into parts beginning with qualitative descriptions that stand alone for students who have taken intermediate algebra. The second part  presents quantitative descriptions that are based on pre-calculus and advanced algebra, providing a more formal treatment for students who have the necessary mathematical background. Understanding these basics enables further understanding both of how systems endure and how they may become increasingly complex and exhibit new properties or characteristics. ·         Serves as a textbook for teaching systems fundamentals in any discipline or for use in an introductory course in systems science degree programs ·         Addresses a wide range of audiences with different levels of mathematical sophistication ·         Includes open-ended questions in special boxes intended to stimulate integrated thinking and class discussion ·         Describes numerous examples of systems in science and society ·         Captures the trend towards interdisciplinary research and problem solving Content Level » Research Keywords » Complexity theory textbook - Cybernetics book - Dynamical systems text - Information theory book - Introduction systems modeling - Introduction systems structure - Systems science book - Systems society book Related subjects » Complexity - Economics Table of contents / Preface / Sample pages  Download Table of contents (pdf, 83 kB) Download Preface 1 (pdf, 141 kB) Download Sample pages 1 (pdf, 211 kB) Popular Content within this publication    7 days 30 days 90 days Articles Show all authors Hide authors Your Shopping Cart   0 eBook Subtotal: 0 To cart Your marked items   Manage your marked Items  You have no marked items.

I will include some aspects of my own work where appropriate, but the majority of what I write about in this series of working papers is a distillation of much fine research done by many others in many related, but usually distinct disciplines. It is highly cross-disciplinary in nature and may challenge some readers to pursue more education in one or more diverse fields. The anchor for this work, that which has provided an overall motivation for it, is I think a legitimate research question that can and should be pursued intellectually. The implications of any answer that is even close to the one I will present has extraordinary practical ramifications. The basic question has been with me from an early age as I noticed that the world as advertised didn\'t seem to line up with the world as I experienced it. The question is basically this: Why, if our species is so smart and creative and rational, do we seem to make such errors of judgment when pursuing our interests and end up making things worse rather than better? I will give examples below. The question stems from a deep interest in understanding the human psyche, how we think, and how do we make decisions. It is spurred on by the observation that so many people seem to be oblivious of the conundrum posed by my question. Most people seem to think nothing of the fact that we claim one thing for ourselves and yet actually behave in a completely different manner. Is this “doublethink” ala George Orwell? Or are our brains wired in ways that prevent us from seeing reality? Of course there is always the possibility that it is me who is out of touch with reality. So at least I would be interested in what kind of psychosis I might be suffering from! Most of my educational efforts have been directed toward coming to grips with these issues. Even my doctoral dissertation focused on a key aspect of how the brain works (and ultimately how the mind works) in the form of how our neurons encode causal relations as a basis for controlling behavior. I used a computer to explore this avenue so I ended up with a PhD in computer science even if the framework of my research was really neurobiology. All of my questions have revolved around the key question of how does the brain work, and how well does it do its job. I spent no small amount of time studying classical artificial intelligence (AI), which led me into cognitive psychology topics. I wanted to get a better understanding of what we really meant by intelligence. So when I got my first academic job I continued the use of my learning algorithm from my dissertation work in the context of a more fully developed autonomous agent that could learn to modify its behavior when conditions in its environment changed. I built more elaborate robots with more elaborate brain-like control systems modeled after simple animal brains. That, along with my on-going interest in matters neurobiological, led me deeper into the exploration of how the brain as a whole might work, especially understanding the issues of memory encoding and representing percepts and concepts in cortical networks. But ultimately it has led me into questions of how those encodings were used in thinking and behavior control. All the while the psychological paradox of our supposed intelligence even while we continued to do stupid things continued to haunt me. More evidence was emerging that showed we were not the logical or rational decision makers that we had assumed we were. Indeed as the evidence grew that we were actually pretty bad at making certain kinds of judgments I began to suspect that we humans lacked something essential as we confronted increasingly complex social and technical problems. Such problems could not be solved by rational thinking alone. My experiences working on committees in academia, ostensibly working on very much less complex, local problems compared with the massive global ones provided me with a clue. Working among people who were, presumably, among the smartest in the world, but who, outside of their domain of expertise demonstrated a certain lack of critical thinking when it came to other kinds of issues, convinced me that what humans lacked, in general was not sufficient intelligence (of the logical/rational kind) but sufficient judgment. Particularly I noticed a lack of experience-based judgment, that which comes from developing what might be called a more ‘generalized’ judgment. Why I noticed this may have been due to the breadth and depth of some of my own life experiences that had covered a variety of activities and jobs. Following that thread I found myself getting into the literature on wisdom. At first this was the general literature that included cultural views of wisdom, what it was, how you recognized it in others, and how it developed in those who embodied it. Later I found the psychological literature and was surprised to learn how advanced some of the thinking was on the issues of judgment and wisdom. And it struck me, somewhere along the way, that this is exactly what is missing in the common person. The attainment of wisdom for individuals was nearly absent in the population as a whole. The more I read about how wisdom functioned, when if functioned, the more I came to realize that the lack of this facility is what was causing our otherwise brilliant people to make such horrible decisions in so many arenas of life. My observations of the judgment behaviors of very smart people can be explained if we posit that our culture has come to have a low regard for wisdom. Many very smart people believe that high intelligence can compensate for experience-based judgment, for wisdom. Indeed our modern western culture eschews wisdom as irrelevant in too many cases due to our obsession with youth and a notion that the past does not provide much insight into the current situations. This is reinforced by our obsession with new technologies that often seem to put older people to a disadvantage in keeping up. I have seen several young, smart people ignore the advice of their elders on the grounds that their own intellects and explicit (domain) knowledge could surely trump whatever thoughts an older person could have. Of course, if the majority of people do not possess the native facility to build wisdom over their lifetimes, no matter how intelligent they are, then most of the time the elders are not as wise as might be needed. And the younger people are not wise enough to recognize true wisdom when they hear it! Good judgment requires several components. First one must have the native mental facilities for learning from life experiences. One must be able to intuit which experiences should be attended to, and extract the meaningful lessons from those experiences. Those experiences must be significant, life altering ones. Both joys and sorrows must provide understanding. And the brain has to integrate those experiences into the background of knowledge already attained. The lessons of experience must expand and deepen the tacit knowledge of the knower. The mental facility also means that the experiencer learn from mistakes as much as, perhaps more, from successes. Indeed the experiencer must recognize when she has made a mistake and self-honestly own up to it. This seems hard for most people to do. They frequently do not even recognize that they have made a mistake, let alone be able to learn from it. It takes a long time to build up the kind of tacit understanding of the world and how it works from the integration of life experiences. Wisdom is often associated with age. But it also takes a brain that is able to facilitate the accumulation of tacit knowledge needed to provide the intuitions that support good judgments. Much has been written about the nature of wisdom, how one gets it, what one does with it, etc. Now there is a growing body of literature regarding the psychological aspects of wisdom, especially, it seems, as pertains to geriatrics and observations of the elder years. But very little has been done with regard to what must be going on in the brain in order to support wisdom as it develops. We have many researchers exploring what goes on in the brain that we would call intelligence or creativity or affect (and combinations of those) but almost nothing that looks at the brain systems that support wisdom development. I hope the approach here may offer impetus to that effort. Part 1. Introduction to the Concept of Sapience Why Haven\'t We Developed a More Perfect World? If we are such a clever species, why is the world the way it is, and heading in a bad direction? Unless one has one\'s head buried in the sand it would be pretty hard to miss the major trends in the world that suggest that, indeed, we finally do find ourselves in that ‘hand basket’ heading to a very hot place. In the case of our world\'s climate, this may be literally true. Global warming is now clearly disrupting what we humans had gotten used to as a ‘normal’ climate. We developed our agriculture/food systems based on what was normal and now it looks like the chaotic climate is going to disrupt food production. And the best science tells us that the rapid change in global average temperature is due to human use of fossil fuels in the industrial economy. The current use of fossil fuels, which grew exponentially since the onset of the Industrial Age, is very clearly causing a global shift in climate. Many very rational people recognize the connection and call for a cessation of the use of fuels. But really how rational is this? It turns out that our whole economic system is dependent on the burning of those fuels. If we simply stopped using them, and there is no real viable replacement for the energy needs to keep the economy going, then our system would crash nearly instantly and billions of people would be left without means for producing food or obtaining water or providing shelter. How is that rational? Of course, the irrational response, coming mainly from the right side of the political spectrum, is to deny that burning fossil fuels is the cause of this conundrum. But here is what is extremely telling about our current situation. We have actually known, that is science has provided us with the knowledge, of the effects of burning fossil fuels for many decades. Indeed some might argue that we could have worked out the consequences over a century ago. If we knew, if we understood the situation, then why did we keep doing it? We were far less dependent on fossil fuels at the end of the 18th century, basically we relied on coal for industry and whale oil for lighting. We were still much less dependent at the end of the 19th century when some scientist began to alert us to what they saw as the potential problem. We could have put the brakes on then and been more cautious in developing our reliance on fossil fuels. Why didn\'t we? Even more telling, in the story of mankind\'s use of fossil fuels, is the very fact that we have long known that their quantities were finite. We have known for a very long time that there is just so much of the stuff in the earth and that it would one day become so difficult to extract that it would, in effect, be gone. We\'ve known this for a very long time. We could even, if we had taken the time to test it, measure the rate at which the energetic cost of obtaining the next unit of energy was rising. We could have estimated from those measurements, along with knowledge of how much of the stuff we\'d already used up, to determine when we would effectively run out as we kept increasing our use at exponential rates. The math is a little demanding, but not really that hard to do. In fact, many people have done the math not just for fossil fuels but for a variety of resources that are either finite or constrained by finite resources. Thomas Malthus, the late 18th and early 19th century political economist readily deduced the relationship between population growth and food availability. He essentially laid out the notion of carrying capacity as a limitation on human populations. Of course, his thesis was about a principle that, ceteris paribus, would take effect to limit the human condition. He was not concerned with what would happen if technology, like the Green Revolution were to make all other things not equal. The question he left us with was: “Under what conditions would this principle ultimately obtain?” We did not really do a good job of asking that question. Well, that isn\'t entirely the case. Some of us did. Paul R. and Anne Ehrlich raised concerns in The Population Bomb about what would happen if population continued to expand exponentially. Rachel Carson sounded the alarm regarding the potential dangers of unrestricted uses of pesticides in Silent Spring. Donella H. and Dennis Meadows, Jrgen Randers, and William W. Behrens III provided actually compelling evidence of what to expect from runaway growth of population and the economy (consumption of resources and production of pollutants) in The Limits to Growth. And these are really just a few examples of the very few people who have actually grasped the significance of what we humans were doing and understood there would be consequences. And, this is the point. The vast majority of humanity, and especially the very clever beings who heard these warnings, simply did not heed the calls. The most clever of all came up with all kinds of reasons why these authors and others were just simply wrong. Rather than wisely attending to the warnings and taking caution, perhaps even calling for more investigation and testing, they simply invented rationalizations to brush those concerns aside so that the rest of humanity could get on with the business of economic growth and prosperity. There is a stark reality rapidly asserting itself into the consciousness of all those happy consumers and wealthy bankers who failed to take notice of the potential problems. It is becoming clearer with each passing day that the Cassandras were right to varying degrees. The global climate is clearly changing in chaotic fashion. We are running out of fossil fuels and many other resources. All of the clever economists were wrong. All of the clever politicians were wrong. All of the clever citizens going about their business as usual were wrong. And now the consequences loom large and dangerous. There are many reasons that people have been able to ignore the evidence and the legitimate reasoning of science. Or as Upton Sinclair said: “Its hard to make a man understand something when his livelihood depends on him not understanding it.” Very intelligent and creative minds can be usurped by deeply held emotional motivations. When someone has been imbued with beliefs that support their life history, especially their comfortable circumstances, and they do not have the wherewithal to question those beliefs (as will become clear below), then something else takes place in the mind. Rather than produce rational reasoning, they can produce rationalized reasons. They can find ways to justify their preconceptions without actually realizing they are doing so. It is done quite often at a subconscious level so as not to raise suspicions of the conscious thinker. And the remarkable thing is that to the conscious observations of the thinker, the rationalizations appear to be perfectly rational. Moreover, the motivation to do so is increased if the introduction of a contrary conception suggests a threat to their preconceptions. Denial is an extraordinarily common reaction to the implications of global warming or peak oil. There are a number of suggested evolutionary reasons why these seemingly dysfunctional mechanisms work the way they do. In some cases it can be argued that denial and rationalization might have lent fitness to our early ancestors. My own view is that it is more likely that the circumstances of life did not test these lackings as dysfunctions. They were never selected against per se. Rather another mechanism emerged that, if fully developed, could override or dampen the effects of these more emotionally motivated responses. This new feature was selected for, initially, but never reached the level of strength needed to completely reign in the dysfunctions. As yet another example of very smart, clever people able to avoid rational thinking, the persistence of the belief in economic and population growth is spite of all the evidence to the contrary stands out as a testament to the lacking of something beyond cleverness in the majority of human minds. Read any opinion piece by renowned economists — people with PhDs — or listen to the various economic and political talking head pundits in the media, or listen to the rhetoric of the President of the United States. They all believe that the only way the economy can be healthy is if it is growing. The simple rationalization is that such an economy produces jobs and creates additional wealth — the tide that raises all boats. Somehow the fact that infinite growth in any real physical system is not even possible in principle never seems to occur to them. They manage this mental legerdemain by believing that the economy is somehow NOT a physical system. Money is not considered a physical constraint so it can grow forever. Moreover, it can generate itself. Investment in an interest bearing account will magically produce more money. What they fail to remember, it seems, is that the only way that works is if the saved money is lent out to do some real physical wealth producing work. It is easy for the mind so steeped in the belief in the growth of money to ignore inconvenient realities because something very fundamental is lacking from their mental processes that would better guide their intelligence in thinking rationally. As a species we have also failed to learn from history to some degree. Humans have made egregious errors throughout time, too many to enumerate here. We have had wars, civilization collapses, and recurring brutalities and never seem to learn that much of it was from our own doing. Even seeming natural disasters can be aggravated by our poor judgments as when people repeatedly build homes in known flood plains or on cliffs overlooking a panoramic view when there is evidence that the cliffs might be subject to collapse. As clever a beast as we are, we are not very good at thinking about long time scales, or learning from historical experiences. Something in our brains, or rather something missing from our brains, seems to preclude capturing the wealth of knowledge from history and assembling a tacit model of how things have actually worked. Rather, our minds focus on individual stories and ‘Great Men’ theories as surrogates for that wealth of knowledge. But, of course, it isn\'t wealthy enough in that surrogate form. We collectively continue to repeat the same mistakes. Our so-called leaders continue to fail across a broad spectrum of decisions that could have been better informed by a greater model of how the world works based on our experience of how it has worked. Humans have proven themselves good at complex problem solving. They have two mental facilities widely acknowledged as the source of their evolutionary success. They are intelligent in many ways and they are creative in finding new ways to do things. Intelligence and creativity have long been studied scientifically by psychologists. More recently neurobiologists and computer scientists have gotten into the field of study. This work has had some expected results. It has told us what we wanted to hear, that we are far above even our nearest relatives when it comes to intelligence and creativity. But there are also some not-so-pleasent stories to tell. It turns out that we are not as rational (in the sense of deductive logic) as we would like to believe. We are motivated, like all animals, by bodily needs and emotional drives. And it turns out that those emotions very much color our perceptions and conceptions even while we enjoy the illusion of making rational choices. Moreover, our brains don\'t really work like computers at all. We run on heuristics not algorithms, and those can and do produce non-veridical results in our decisions and subsequent behaviors. We are usually making mistakes. We are not quite as clever as we thought we were. The combination of intelligence and creativity I like to think of as cleverness. Even if intelligence is not really that rational, still it works pretty well in terms of solving local-scale problems, especially where the costs of small mistakes aren\'t that great. It has provided our kind with incredible adaptive capabilities as we spread across the globe and invaded numerous different ecosystems. Cleverness worked out pretty well for us as long as the world was relatively simple (by comparison to today\'s industrial/information age). But it was that very cleverness that created the technologies and procedures that have led to the modern world and all of its complexities. This world is now so complex that ordinary clever people cannot begin to grasp it. And so we blindly follow whatever rules of conduct we are told are the right ones to keep things going. But cleverness was not enough. As can be seen by the above examples of foolishness in not heeding the warnings of seers, we, as a species, seem to be lacking something crucial that prevents us from using our cleverness in ways that will provide for long-term stability and the affirmation of human and all life. We do not, very often or sufficiently, use our cleverness wisely. Fools rush in where wise men fear to tread. And rush we collectively have. Wisdom is basically the ability to make sound judgments that guide our decision processes when cleverly solving problems. There seems to be ample evidence that the majority of we humans are not wise in any real meaningful way. And, ironically, it isn\'t just a matter of being more clever. Some of the most intelligent and creative people in history have been shown to make foolish mistakes too often to simply write off as mere ‘oops’. My thesis is simply this. Humans evolved just enough capacity for wisdom to be successful in tribal organizations as far as living in the natural world. But at some point in our history our cleverness created a cultural environment that began to select against further development of the capacity for wisdom. Ergo, that capacity could not expand in the same way that the combination of cleverness and culture (especially technology developments) did. The latter overtook and damped down the capacity to develop wisdom in favor of some of those more basic affective drives that guide decisions from the more primitive parts of the brain. Essentially, we created a situation in which the very capacity that had gotten us to the threshold of what I call second order consciousness (conscious of being conscious — explained later) would no longer develop. In a sense it was no longer needed. Cleverness fed through the mechanics of culture would take over as the only, seemingly, needed capacity to thrive in the world. What little native capacity for wisdom remains in our species must be very poorly distributed in the population. Every once in a while an individual with uncommon insights and good judgment emerges in the limelight, especially focused in crisis situations, and we recognize that quality of wisdom (Nelson Mandela and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi come to my mind) in their advice and decisions. To be sure, many elders display some level of wisdom in conducting their own affairs. Wisdom is historically and culturally associated with age. But also culturally, we most often discount the elderly as not having relevance to a dynamic, progressive society. They are very often shuttled off to some home for the aged and are generally treated as a kind of liability to the economy. Youth is what is favored in the capitalist economic system particularly. Thus I claim we humans, on average, are stunted when it comes to the capacity for wisdom. That capacity must originate in the brain. It must be based on brain structures and functions that are heritable and developable just as much as is the case for intelligence and creativity. Wisdom, coming with age, is actually a manifestation of that capacity along with the acquisition of life experiences that contribute to our intuitions and judgments. Brains that have a more developed capacity can give rise to greater wisdom later in life. I prefer to use the term sapience when referring to the capacity of the brain. I use this term because, among other aspects, our species is called Homo sapiens, “man the wise”. This binomial nomenclature designation was bestowed on us by the inventor of the systemics naming system, Carl Linnaeus who thought it best described humans. In a real sense, of course, one of the defining features of humans is their ability to make judgments on issues that have a much wider and longer-term scope than any other animal in nature. It is not likely that chimpanzees think much about what might happen next year if they do thus and so today. Humans do think about the future and ask questions about outcomes of actions taken in the present. So the basic capacity does seem to be present. We do possess a modicum of sapience, surely. But I maintain, it simply isn\'t enough to overcome our baser tendencies to use our cleverness for short-term gains that will cost us dearly in the long term. From Whence Cometh Wisdom? Intuitions and judgments come from deep within the mind, from the subconscious levels of thinking. They arise, as it were, to conscious awareness and have the role of guiding conscious decisions. The mind is doing an incredible amount of work in sorting out all of the variables and conditions that constitute a complex situation. Those men and women who seem to be able to effortlessly provide a recommendation (guidance) in complex social problems that proves to be worthwhile in the long run are noted as ‘wise’ individuals, so long as there are those who are able to recognize the advice and take it (note that in eastern cultures there is still some reverence for the elders as being wise, especially still in agrarian regions) . Most often, and this seems to be a universal characteristic, such individuals are more elderly. The wise elder is an enduring meme in our collective consciousness. Wisdom is the capacity to make good moral judgments in complex social problems that are life supporting for the majority of a society for the longest time into the future (Sternberg, 1990). Wisdom is a behavior of individuals who are competent in learning life experiences in a manner that gives rise to veridical intuitions later in life. It must be based on a brain function and competency level that increases the likelihood of survival and reproduction of the species or it would not have become a feature of human mentation. It can be argued, from the anthropological record, that early human groups that possessed at least one very wise leader were more fit than other groups in surviving the exigencies of life. Indeed, an argument can be made that the wisdom of the older members of a tribe contributed to the group fitness and thus to the differential success of those groups. Wisdom in the ways of the world was the evolutionary basis for the success of Homo sapiens. Grandparents, the locus of wisdom, could transmit that fitness to their children and especially their grandchildren thus providing a differential reproductive success advantage to their kin group. In the late Pleistocene era, wisdom was a success strategy for early man. As the genus Homo evolved there was a progressive orientation toward two-partner mating (or some would argue toward mild polygamous mating) as child rearing became more expensive energetically. Along with this arrangement, humans were living longer past their reproductive ages. It seems that these grandparents took an interest in their children\'s children (perhaps because in a monogamous or semi-monagomous relationship it is easier to trace one\'s progeny) and their upbringing. An interesting correlated hypothesis, the Grandmother Hypothesis postulates the continued capacity for postmenopausal women to rear youngsters led to stabilization of the family units and contributed to the success of the species. The development of wisdom depends on the emergence and differential development of brain areas that contribute to capturing, organizing, and recall of tacit knowledge. In Part 4 of this series I will delve more deeply into the neuroscience of sapience as it pertains to the brain, and in Part 5 I will further develop the evolutionary ideas just mentioned, but also consider the future of sapience. Psychological Constructs To begin an explication of this hypothesis we need to start with the current understanding of the psychological theories of intelligence, creativity, wisdom, and affect. A considerable amount of work has been done regarding these various ‘constructs’[1]. A great deal of credit for the substantive work in this area should be given to Robert Sternberg who has orchestrated a very useful compendium of work that delineates both the relationships between and the differences between these constructs (Sternberg, 1990; Sternberg, 2003). In Fig. 1 I have attempted to delineate these constructs in a kind of Venn diagram. Fundamentally, the four aspects of mental life have both individual characteristics, but also share some characteristics that account for the correlations that a number of researchers have noted in the above referenced works.   Figure 1. There are four major features or constructs to the human mind. The affect system represents the emotional and autonomic systems that we inherited from the most primitive animals (particularly reptiles). Intelligence, creativity, and more recently, wisdom are basic constructs that have been studied by psychology. Of course many other areas, such as perception, are important, but are seen as contributory to these main constructs. The relative sizes of the ovals is meant to convey the sense in which each of these constructs seem to dominate human mentation. Wisdom (sapience) is envisioned as the newest and least developed capacity of the human mind.   Wisdom shares some aspects with both intelligence and creativity (Sternberg, 2003a) as well as having an emotional aspect (Kramer, 1990). This is why I used overlapping ovals in the above post reference. All four components of mentation interact and operate together to produce the complete, normal conscious person. In the second installment in this series I will break down the relationship between sapience and the other three constructs of mind in more detail. This overview has been meant to simply set up the framework of these relationships. Here I want to further dissect the nature of sapience to delineate it from the common concepts of intelligence and creativity and to disabuse the reader of thinking that sapience is just more of these. Thinking The four psychological constructs play unique but mutually interactive roles in the conscious experience of thinking. Our thoughts are shaped by the interplay between them. Actually, our conscious thoughts are, so to speak, only the tip of the cognition iceberg. Our brains carry on far more processing at a subconscious level than most of us might imagine. Since it is, by definition, subconscious, and therefore not ‘visible’ to conscious awareness, our conscious minds can be fooled into believing that the thoughts we experience come from some effortful process, especially from our intelligence. But in fact, they are now thought to emerge as perceptually or conceptually initiated structures. Indeed evidence suggests that a number of structures emerge simultaneously in various parts of the brain, e.g. areas responsible for creatively combining basic concepts in new ways or areas responsible for activating beliefs. These multiple pre-thoughts are then tested and filtered in various ways until something like a fully formed thought emerges into the limelight of conscious awareness. That thought may then be incorporated into an intentional structure such as a sentence or an action.   Figure 2. The conscious mind involves a relatively small proportion of our total mental activities. Here the unconscious mind forms essentially a core in which the mental activities of the four constructs operate to produce thoughts that eventually emerge into the outer conscious mind.   It now appears that the subconscious mind does an extraordinary amount of thinking. Most of this thinking is likely to be in the form of pattern recognition, matching, and categorization based on heuristic associations. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it must be a duck. These thoughts emerge as intuitions or, as we will see, judgments that guide decision making. Other forms of thinking correspond with what we normally think of as logical reasoning. This is thinking that is sequential and based on what I think of as ‘tight’ heuristics. These are rules that are nearly like rational reasoning, e.g. syllogistic, or even predicate logic. They involve concepts that are essentially symbol-like (almost non-mutable), but that can be used to represent variables, and combine those symbols according to the tight heuristics such that the derivation of a conclusion is very close to what we would call sound (veridical). Almost all minds can perform the simpler forms of formal logic, but fewer have the ability to perform the higher forms. Nevertheless, the subconscious mind appears to have this facility and produces thoughts that can then be further manipulated by conscious language, as when someone is trying to think through what a logical or likely outcome of a specific action might be. This process can be most readily seen in certain kinds of games, like chess. Master chess players use a combination of logic and pattern recognition/manipulation to decide on their moves. They examine the board and the pattern of pieces calls into their subconscious minds all similar patterns that have previously been encountered by that player. Those patterns are tagged with affective valence (see Part 2 for more explanation) as well as tacit weighting having to do with prior wins and losses. The mind then filters all of the relevant patterns as well as uses the reasoning system to make a move decision. Part of the decision is rational and part intuition or judgment. Several authors in psychology have posited the existence of two thinking systems as just described (c.f. Sloman, 2002 for a review). They view the use of these two systems in terms of both working on a problem simultaneously and then the mind essentially resolving any differences or choosing one solution over the other. In a very real sense this is the ‘heart versus head’ conundrum that most of us experience at various times in our lives. In Part 4, The Neuroscience of Sapience, I will delve much deeper into the kinds of neural structures that might underlie these two, what we might think of as extremes, of thinking. I will argue there that I suspect the seeming dual systems of thinking is actually just the psychological observation of the two ends of a spectrum of neural processing structures that actually share some basic architectures. Combined with the conscious vs. subconscious processing, its apparent duality, this actually provides for a generally very smooth global thought processing. The same kinds of neural structures, composed of similar kinds of neurons, can simply produce more rule-like or more pattern-like processing. Indeed, in some instances it takes both working together to even represent things like the variables needed for predicate-style logic. However, the twin dualities of conscious versus unconscious and logic-like versus pattern-like processing serve reasonably well in understanding some of the more mysterious aspects of the mind. Figure 3 shows a slightly different image of the four mental constructs, shifted around a little and with a line demarcating a (somewhat arbitrary) boundary between logical and pattern processing. Note that the latter occupies a much greater fraction of all of the construct areas.   Figure 3. A hypothetical division of the mind between two complementary processing systems, a logic-like system responsible for rule-based reasoning, and a pattern processing system responsible for similarity matching. The latter is shown as having a much greater amount of total mental capacity and accounts for almost all affective processing, most creativity, and a fair amount of intelligence and sapience. Logical reasoning is relegated to smaller portions of each. However, intelligence, which is what most people think of in terms of logical reasoning, carries the weight for thinking things through rationally.   The line dividing the logical (rule-based) from the pattern (associative) forms of thinking is placed to indicate that much more actual thinking takes place in the form of pattern-processing and associations than logic and rule-based inferences. Most humans, most of the time, deal with the world as they find it by pattern matching with memories of similar situations rather then thinking through the logical inferences. This is because most life situations do not require thinking through of the sequences of premises to conclusions. If we have had life experiences that encoded in our memories as meaningful situations, we will preferentially draw upon those experiences and linkages to meaningful outcomes to guide action decisions in the here and now. Besides, thinking logically requires considerably more work and time and most people have difficulty thinking through the situation when too many variables are involved (seven plus or minus two variables seems to be the average size chunks that most people can handle). Most of our thinking is associative, and most of it takes place in the subconscious. A small smattering, then, takes place in conscious awareness and involves sequences of rules applied to propositions and variables, what most of us think of as thinking. Indeed one very plausible explanation for the conscious mind (or evolutionarily, what is consciousness for?) is that it evolved as an addendum to our ordinary supervisory functions (e.g. impulse control) specifically to orchestrate logical thinking. In fact several authors liken the conscious mind to a conductor of an orchestra. Some more elaborated supervisory functions need to selectively (and programmatically) activate specific other cognitive functions at just the right time in order to produce what we experience as conscious thinking, especially the experience of talking ourselves through a situation in our heads (silently). I will return to this whole subject and provide some more details of how this might be accomplished in neural tissues and brain regions given what we currently understand about these. But here I would like to point out a simple fact. Though I have referred to the conscious process of thinking as a logic-like system, in fact it is highly prone to many kinds of errors. It is not fully constrained to only use a priori true premises or axioms (in math and deductive logic). Nor is it constrained to only use valid inference rules. Indeed we invented mathematics and formal logics, done by writing the symbols and rules down in an external representation, precisely because our brains have greater or lesser degrees of competence when trying to think through more complex problems and situations. Unfortunately, the formal systems we invented don\'t scale to most real life situations and complexities. For that we humans rely on other mechanisms to convey patterns that can be combined and manipulated (as I inferred above) in what we call stories or narratives. These, some of universal experience, can be combined and recombined in ways to produce new, interesting stories. Our fictional prose and poetry reflect our attempts to capture almost-rule-like, language-based patterns that can be shared around, not just for entertainment, but to teach lessons and educate the young. Such story construction, involving all parts of the cognitive constructs, are examples of how the supposed two systems cooperate to produce hybrid thoughts, neither purely logical nor purely associative. The Components of Sapience I would now like to start deconstructing the functions of sapience in the cognitive framework established above. In this introduction I will outline the components of sapience that seem the most salient at present. In Part 2 I will expand on this theme paying particular attention to the interrelationships between the components so that we understand how they interoperate to produce human thinking and consciousness. In Part 3 I will delve even deeper into each component, as it were peeling the layers of the onion to reveal more detail. In a manner similar to the diagram of the mind introduced above in Figure 1, Figure 4 below shows a diagram of the components of sapience. The four components are judgment, moral sentiment, strategic perspective (thinking), and systems perspective (thinking). Each will be described briefly along with their relationships to the other mental components of intelligence, creativity, and affect. In the figure they are shown overlapping because they all interrelate to one another in very complex ways in exactly the same way that intelligence, creativity, affect, and sapience interrelate.   Figure 4. Sapience decomposed into four basic functions, judgment, moral sentiment, strategic perspective, and systems perspective.   The arrows, from and to external functions, in the figure are meant to roughly represent the recurrent messages that pass between functions (and presumably between brain centers that are involved in processing them). The overlapping of central functions in sapience means to convey the tight integration of these functions without explicitly representing it with arrows. Note the thick arrow from judgment to intelligence & creativity. This is meant to convey the effect judgment has on these processes (see below). Note also the box labeled ‘tacit knowledge’. This is the storehouse of implicit memory encodings that connect conceptual memories in functional ways. It is, in effect, our model (or models) of how the world works. All of the functions of mind (intelligence & creativity - I&C - and affect) and all of the functions of sapience affect tacit knowledge. I&C act to form concepts and their relations and link them to the tacit knowledge store. Affect tags each such linkage with valence (good or bad affect; Damasio, 1994). Judgment informs what new knowledge should be incorporated and how it should be integrated into our existing tacit storehouse. Similarly, strategic and systems perspectives help guide this process (knowledge acquisition) as well as helping interpret stored strategic and systems knowledge for the judgment function. Finally, moral sentiment, our sense of rightness and wrongness, guide the integration with respect to our social mores and rules of conduct. Judgment The capacity for judgment has started to come under the study of psychology and neuroscience in recent years. Judgment is one of those ineffable capacities that seems somehow related to intuition and yet clearly is linked with rational thinking and decision making. On the one hand, our judgments come unbidden from somewhere in our minds to guide our decisions, yet most of us do not really have a conscious experience of forming a judgment (Hogarth, 1980, see esp. page 1). It is just something we all do. Judgment is an integral part of decision making. In Part 2 of this series of papers I will delve more deeply into that relationship and show how the mechanics of decision making, a function of intelligence, is mediated and shaped by judgment. For now note that we make judgments about almost everything without really thinking about it. More primitive minds are guided in decision making (presumably without conscious thought, or at least a language) more by affective drives than by intelligent reasoning, and those drives are built-in. I refer here to the primitive reptilian brain which is reactive to environmental cues that trigger emotion-like responses. The classic fight-or-flight response is a good example. In those minds there is no higher consideration of the circumstances or overriding of the initial response because there is no higher brain functions to evaluate the ‘real’ situation or broader context of the cues. The affective modulation of decision processing had worked very well through the evolution of the reptiles. The evolutionary hardwiring of responses to cues based upon temporally immediate survival considerations was sufficient as a control for behavior. We humans (and all mammals) have inherited this basic judgment system. And, all too often, it can take the upper hand in modulating our more rational sides, as when you lose your temper and behave badly as a result. Human minds have an added advantage in being able to bring more complex learned knowledge to bear on decisions even when we are not consciously trying to do so. That does not mean we are completely rational in our choices. Quite to the contrary the system of acquiring tacit knowledge and bringing it to bear in judgments guiding decision making is far from perfect, as we will see. Our brains have many built-in biases that keep us from making completely rational decisions (see: Gilovich et al, 2002). And, indeed, it seems that most humans tend to rely more on their affective system guidance in most day-to-day or ordinary sorts of decision problems (like what socks to wear) than the experience-based approach. The reason is actually quite rational in the sense of saving time and energy. Most of the time our affective inputs to simple decisions work reasonably well. In a simpler world, where our major concerns involved conspecifics (both us and them) and nature (predators and prey) the kinds of judgments we needed to make were relatively simple. They needed lots of tacit knowledge, to be sure, but were about things that could readily be learned and understood in our model of the world. But as the world changes more rapidly and gets more complex our native judgment capacities are being put to the test. As Robin Hogarth puts it (1980): However, the increasing interdependency and complexity of modern life means that judgment now has to be exercised on matters with more important consequences than was ever the case in the past. Moreover, the frequency with which people are called upon to make important judgments in unfamiliar circumstances is growing. The modern world is putting our capacity to build an adequate storehouse of tacit knowledge and our capacity to make critical judgments from whatever knowledge we are able to obtain to the test, most severely. Complex problems and the decisions needed to solve them require more effort and time. The brain has to kick into a mode of decision making that requires more rigorous thinking, both conscious and subconscious. Thus it is not unreasonable that we relegate much of our everyday decision processing to guidance from the limbic system and the paleocortical brain[2] more than from the neocortical brain (See Part 4). As we will see the circuits for affective and more primitive experiential (e.g. routine patterns stored in the paleocortex) inputs to decisions are already in place and a very rapid activation of those circuits is all that is needed to produce reasonable decisions. But when the problems are really complex and convoluted, emotions, feelings and simple patterns cannot provide adequate guidance. That is where tacit knowledge comes into the picture. That is where sapience takes an upper hand, sometimes needing to down modulate the affective inputs, sometimes overriding them entirely. Good judgment is necessary for good decisions. The more complex a problem, especially social problems, the larger the scale of involvement. More factors are involved. More people will be affected. More time will be needed. One has to think about the future and what impact the current actions will have on that future. The scope of space and time is much greater and the possible variations are literally too numerous to work through in a purely logical sense. Such problems have a more ‘global’ scale of impact and that poses a serious problem for judgment. The reason is relatively simple. Every problem is composed of a network of sub-problems that all affect one another (see below on Systems Perspective). Yet the conscious mind must focus on one local problem at a time. If all that is brought to bear on decisions regarding that local problem is intelligence (and a smattering of creativity) there will be a tendency to try to find what we call a ‘local optimum’ solution. The reason is that we typically only have local explicit information to use in forming a decision about what to do. That local information will not include the fact that just around the next bend, out of our local (i.e., conscious) view, is an obstacle or a precipice — other related sub-problems that might be made worse by solving the current problem for its optimum. We are forced to make decisions using our intelligence and the best local information we can muster. But it does not guarantee us that we are making the right decision in a global sense. In fact there are many examples of how solving a local sub-problem for an optimum will make the global problem much worse. Tacit knowledge, if it is relatively complete and relatively valid (if our models of the whole is good) can then come into play subconsciously to alter or shape the intelligent decision making to override local optimization if there is a chance of lowering the global optimization of the larger problem. Hence, we higher mammals, and especially humans, have brains that allow us to build a storehouse of global knowledge over our lives (if we survive!) and use that to guide intelligence in making that decision based on local information. Fortunately many decision points have characteristics of situations we have seen in the past. As such we can apply our implicit knowledge, gained in the past, to anticipate the results of a current decision. Even this does not guarantee an absolutely correct decision. But it is better than only using local information alone. There is a category of computational algorithms that mimic this concept somewhat called dynamic programming. The basic idea is to build a table of prior decisions that were successful on the chance that the same decision point may be encountered later in the computation. Then rather than solve the decision again, the algorithm simply looks in the table to extract the solution. This is a major time saver in many kinds of decision problems (and a kind of machine learning). Unfortunately computers are constrained to working on only a small piece of information at a time whereas the brain can do a massively parallel search for the needed information (See Part 4). The more comprehensive a model (tacit knowledge) we have the more likely our decisions will prove adequate. Comprehensive here means covering a larger scope of space and a longer time scale. The more and varied life experiences we have had and the more lessons we have learned about those experiences the more power we bring to bear on the present local situation. This is why the brightest people who have lived long seem to be the wisest in general. They have brains capable of storing large knowledge sets with reliable and ready access to memories. They have in their age lived long and experienced more than average. And those experiences and their meanings are encoded in tacit form. It gets back to brain competency. The brain of someone who has a higher level of sapience has the competency to acquire the right kinds of tacit knowledge and has the competency to use that knowledge to maximize the likelihood of making good decisions in a complex, fast moving world. Another critical aspect to sapient judgment is the capacity to judge one\'s own judgments. One of the attributes of wisdom seems to be the capacity for a wise person to not pass judgments on some issues when their tacit knowledge does not include experiences that apply. In other words, a wise person knows when they do not know enough to offer a judgment (which has the form of an opinion). They, like everyone else, could still rely on the built in heuristic models (Part 3 will offer details of how this works) and form opinions on these subjects. But their sapience includes the capability to recognize their own limitations and can prevent or override an urge to offer an opinion even when one has no real, efficacious tacit knowledge with which to form such opinions. All ‘merely’ (nominally) sapient humans are strongly motivated to construct explanations about happenings in the world, even when they do not have adequate information with which to do so. They construct these explanations anyway as forms of casual or informal hypotheses with the possibility that gaining additional information might allow them to refine or modify their tentative explanation in the future. This is actually a part of the building process for gaining tacit knowledge. But it can work against most people when they do not recognize that their tentative hypotheses are just that. When they, instead, fail to recognize that they do not really have the tacit knowledge needed to form more sound judgments, they offer up opinions anyway! One can witness this phenomenon most starkly in people who hold nominal leadership positions in organizations or society. Their own self-image as well as the expectations of their ‘followers’, puts pressure on them to have the answers. Yet, and especially in a culture that values youth, they tend not to have the tacit knowledge to form efficacious judgments. Even so they are compelled to form an opinion. The followers can only hope that either the leader is uncommonly brilliant and can apply rational logic using explicit knowledge or gets lucky and guesses a good solution. But they cannot count on the leader being wise. Moral sentiment Altruism evolved in social mammals (and birds) as a means of increasing the fitness of the group over that of individuals (Sober & Wilson, 1994) and the general fitness of the species. We evolved a sense of right and wrong behavior in ourselves and others. The specifics of many practices and social mores vary from culture to culture, but all cultures have rules of behavior that reflect the inner sense of moral and ethical sentiments. Moral sentiment appears to be a universal property of human cognition. While many religious and conservative people believe that moral reasoning (the \'axioms\' and rules) comes from a higher power, the scientific evidence that our brains are hardwired by evolution to base judgments on inherent, and subconscious, moral sentiments is now solid. The drive to moral reasoning is built into us as social creatures who need to cooperate more than compete within our tribe. Higher moral sentiments provide guidance to our acquisition and use of tacit knowledge and our modulation of the limbic system\'s automatic responses to prevent unreasoned actions. We have the ability to inhibit our tendency to get even with someone who has hurt us. We have the ability to inhibit our tendency to want to bed the first beauty we could otherwise seduce. Higher sapience means that we will exercise this control over our primitive urges. Moral sentiment and higher judgment work together to produce that which we think of as a significant difference between ourselves and mere animals. There is another, perhaps even more important, aspect of moral sentiment that needs to be mentioned. Moral sentiment is driven primarily from the affective component of the mind. And one of the most powerful aspects of affect is love (hate is potentially even more powerful, but only for the lower sapient mind). That is, the human sentiment to cherish other beings in various ways, as mates, as offspring, as neighbors and friends, etc. is one of the most important factors in social organization and the sense of moral motivation. When all is right with the world, we love one another. This attractive force runs deeper in sapience than is generally appreciated. It is not just gushing emotion. It is a real basis for caring and thus motivation for thinking about the good for all. Wise persons, throughout history, have often been described as loving their constituents. Systems Perspective One of the main problems with a notion of higher sapience being dependent on more brain power in acquiring massive amounts of knowledge is that the brain is, after all, limited in its ability to encode memories. However, the memory capacity of the brain depends on how the knowledge is encoded. We now know that our memories are not simple recordings of happenings or images. Rather the brain builds conceptual hierarchical codes to represent things, relationships, movements, and so on. The brain re-uses representations through complex neural networks which allow sharing low level features among many higher-level concepts. The brain also organizes concepts in a hierarchical classification scheme that allows ready associations. For example our hierarchy of \'mammal-dog-fido\' associated with \'dog-pet-fido\' allows us to relate other kinds of dog-like animals and compare features, such as \'mammal-wolf-teeth-aggressive\' with \'mammal-dog-teeth-friendly(mostly)\'. It is the organization of concepts into networked hierarchies that allow us to not have to store every little detail with every instance of a thing, place, or action. Rather, we now know that our brains reconstruct memories from cues by activating a specific network of associated neural clusters. The brain is designed to store massive amounts of encoded \'engrams\' but only because it knows how to organize the components in such a way that many engrams can share sub-circuits. There is another trick to organizing knowledge to achieve maximum compression. That is to base the organization of knowledge on universal models that pertain to all aspects of life. The most general such model is systemness, or the nature of general systems. No matter how complex the world seems, it is resolvable into a hierarchy of systems within systems. That is everything is a system and a sub-system of some larger meta-system. Systems have universal properties even though their forms may seem significantly different. Some systems with fuzzy boundaries may not even be readily recognizable. Yet the world, indeed the universe, is organized as systems within systems with varying degrees of inter connectivity, complexity, and organization. Some systems are too small to be detected with the normal human senses (bacteria and single-celled organisms). Some systems are too huge to be readily detected (the galaxy) by ordinary sensory means. Some systems are so diffuse that they cannot be easily categorized as a system (the atmosphere). But as long as there are aggregates of matter and flows of energy there are systems. As an aside, if this were not true, then science could not work as it does! The mammalian brain is wired so as to perceive and conceive of the world as systems of systems. That is to say, our perceptual systems are genetically organized so as to detect boundaries, coherencies, patterns of interactions and connectedness, and many other attributes of systemness. We see things and we see those things interact in causal ways. We literally can\'t help it. This built-in capacity is the basis for learning how the world works. Above I alluded to the idea that tacit knowledge was a form of model (or models) of how the world works. And here I claim that the encoding of tacit knowledge begins with the grasp of systems. To see things as systems and to recognize things interacting with one another in causal ways is, however, not enough for what I am calling a systems perspective. All animals to greater or lesser degrees have the ability to encode systemness (see Part 4). Humans have the added ability to compose models of their world using systemness as a guide to construction of those models in memory. This affords us an ability to play ‘What-if’ games or test possible outcomes by altering some variables and running the models in fast forward. In other words we can think about the future. Even so, as remarkable as this ability might be, most people do it more or less without conscious recognition. It is so natural to do we rarely even consider how marvelous a facility it is. Sapience goes a step further. It involves thinking about thinking about the future, but also it involves thinking about systemness itself. In other words, higher sapience involves more comprehensive systems thinking. This comes out in several ways. One of the first and most important is the natural tendency to ask questions such as what larger system is this sub-system a part? Effectively sapience drives us to want to understand the context of what we perceive in the immediate arena of interest. Or, we ask what are the sub-systems inside this system (of interest) that make it work the way it does? Curiosity and a willingness to probe deeper or outward are necessary ingredients to support increasing one\'s tacit knowledge. The sapient person has the formula for how to answer these questions by following the properties of systemness. They know what they are looking for in terms of roles to be played in a systems organization and dynamics even if they don\'t know in advance what the specific ‘thing’ looks like. The capacity to quickly organize new information on the basis of systemic principles is what allows some people to learn completely new cultures, jobs, or even careers. They can relate the specifics of a newly encountered system to the general principles of systemness and learn to manipulate the new system based on those principles applying. It is a strong perspective of systemness that allows some people, and especially the more sapient, to build a comprehensive storehouse of tacit knowledge and later to use that knowledge to rapidly adapt to new system particulars. Systems recognition and perspective is at the base of the aphorism \"There is nothing new under the sun.\" Or the expression that \"No matter how much things change, they stay the same.\" Wisdom is often characterized by a person\'s ability to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty. This ability is greatly enhanced by the systems perspective. It permits one to be calm in the face of uncertainty, for example, knowing that systems dynamics may seem chaotic (in the vernacular sense) but are really part of the probabilistic nature of the cosmos. Systems thinking gives resolve to the notion that while there may be great ambiguity now, further investigation (gaining additional information) will reduce ambiguity since the systems principles hold universally. In other words, this is the source of faith for the wise. The world will become clear in time! Strategic Perspective You may have noticed that the world is forever changing. Systems thinking helps one adapt to change by providing generic templates of systemness that can be used as scaffolding for learning new things. But if one is to do better than simply react to change and hope to adapt then one has to employ a more advanced form of thinking — strategic thinking. As with systems thinking most people are able to do some strategic thinking, at least from time to time. But the vast majority of people stick to logistical and tactical decision making which is why our species has a tendency to discount the future and make near-term decisions on profitability. Strategic thinking is the most advanced form of thinking about the future (mentioned above). It is more than just playing what-if games. It also involves incorporating important global objectives into the models and deriving plans that will be used to drive tactical and logistical thinking into the future. Strategic thinking involves developing a vision of what the future world will be like and then picturing yourself (or your group) integrated into that future world in a way that is both satisfying and sustainable. The importance of strategic thinking as an individual capacity is just beginning to dawn on some psychologists and evolutionary psychologists. So there isn\'t yet a large body of literature on this. What exists comes, again, from the judgment literature where people have been studying the systemic biases in human judgment that prevent people from thinking long-term, especially subconsciously. But it should be clear that a wise person is concerned with what will happen in the long run. A wise person will counsel for actions today that will have a positive impact on the future even when he or she will not be a part of that future. Average humans are relatively short-sighted. They cannot really imagine what the distant tomorrow will bring. Or they cannot envision what they need to do in order to fit into that distant tomorrow. My suspicion is that our species was just starting to evolve higher capacities for strategic thinking (which explains why we even know what strategic thinking is!) as an advancement of our evolving sapience. But with the advent of technology, and especially agriculture, the selection pressures that would have moved us further in that direction were removed. The result is that the vast majority of people do not think very strategically, even about their own lives let alone the lives of their fellow beings and the lives of future generations. In Part 4, The Neuroscience of Sapience, I will describe the model of the brain that I think best describes the nature of human thinking and accounts for the functions of sapience. Specifically I will show how the hierarchical cybernetic model[3] describes brain architecture and functions as are being elucidated by neuroscience. Briefly, the hierarchical cybernetic model is a description of the management of a complex system based on operational level controls (e.g. the feedback controls used to regulate low-level work processes), logistical level coordination (e.g. the coordination of many operational subsystems and distribution of resources in order to optimize the global behavior of a complex system), tactical level coordination (essentially equivalent to logistical level but focused on coordination with external systems so as to obtain needed resources and avoid external threats), and, finally, strategic level management (as just described above). The human brain is a management and control system that regulates our bodies, our behaviors relative to the external environment, and, even if only weakly, our future.   Figure 5. The brain is a hierarchical cybernetic system that mirrors some of our organizational governance systems. Low level work processes need to get resource inputs from environmental entities. They interact internally by doing work on those resources and passing the intermediate products on to the next process in the system. Certain sub-systems (processes) are tasked with expelling the products (or waste products) out to the environment. This level in the hierarchy requires some feedback cooperative control (arrows with solid heads) but ultimately needs a higher, more integrated level of coordination control from a logistical coordinator that monitors the operations (not shown to avoid clutter) and provides directives to processes to assure the optimal distribution of resources. At the same basic level, the tactical coordinator monitors the immediate external world in order to coordinate the activities of the input and output processors with the availability of resources and product sinks. Monitoring the larger world, including entities not directly involved in input/output, is the strategic manager (actually a planner). This level of management also monitors the coordination levels and then provides goals and plans to that level. The time scale for activities of each level is greater as you go up the hierarchy from operations.   My central claim is that the hierarchical cybernetic theory best explains the current situation with respect to brain functions that give rise to human psychology and behavior. The strategic level of self-management was the most recent capability to emerge and constitutes a deep integral part of sapience. Sapience and the resultant wisdom that might obtain therefrom are ultimately dependent on strategic thinking but not just for the individual. Rather, the whole move toward group success relied on the strategic perspective of the group leader(s), the wise elders, who thought ahead for the good of the whole group. I will revisit this in Part 5, The Evolution of Sapience. Other Psychological Attributes Associated with Wisdom The psychological literature on wisdom is full of descriptions of attributes most strongly associated with wisdom, but that do not seem to neatly fit into functional categories. Wise people are often described as having contentment, calmness, peace of mind, and so on, even in the face of stresses and turmoil in their world. The ability to live with ambiguity and uncertainty without becoming anxious is also often noted. And, perhaps most important, wise people have an ability to know when they don\'t know. That is they are aware of their own knowledge limitations and do not attempt to offer opinions regarding issues for which they have no basic understanding. I would argue that the latter quality is still one of judgment. As I will discuss in Part 3, we make second-order judgments subconsciously about the quality of our first-order judgments. This is especially important in judging, for example, the strength of evidence that our minds can bring to bear on an opinion (Griffin & Tversky, 2002). Less wise people tend to be overly confident in their own judgments and this is compounded by an inability to recognize their mistakes and learn from them. The feelings of contentment in the face of adversity, however, would not seem to be recognized as a function of judgment on first blush. But as I will argue in Part 3 when we look at the components of sapience, what I call the judgment processor provides inputs down to the affect system, which includes damping down the outputs of the fear/anxiety processes (also see Part 4, The Neuroscience of Sapience in which I discuss the relationship between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala where such emotions are triggered.) Thus I think many of the attributes that are often ascribe to wise people, having to do with a sense of calmness and even satisfaction with the world as it is found are the result of the relationship between sapience and affect (implied by the overlap in Fig. 1). It should be no surprise that as one acquires greater wisdom a certain quality of serenity also attends. The systems perspective provides an overall or holistic picture of the workings of the world and with that a sense of the dynamics following a natural course. Even when that course is negative or threatening, the wise person can often take solace in the idea that evolution is unfolding as it should and must. And with the long view of strategic perspective, one can accept the unfolding events as natural. This seeming acquiescence to negative forces may seem to the less wise, especially the young, as a kind of abrogation of caring about what happens. They would ‘fight the good fight’ to overcome any challenge. They might think the elders have just grown too tired to fight and have given up. But the wise elder can recognize the inevitable. They may council against the fight, depending on the circumstances, or they might be content to let the young carry on the fight even when they suspect they will lose. The wise person will have a good sense of when it doesn\'t hurt to try! With wisdom comes acceptance of the way the world is. If there is an opportunity to make the world a little different such that everyone and everything is better off, so much the better. Summary Sapience is the brain basis for what is unique in human cognition. It is significantly evolved in the current human species and demonstrably produces very important executive functions in this species. It is the basis for the development of whatever capacity for wisdom we see in humans. Wisdom develops over the life of an individual as a result of sapience functions obtaining tacit knowledge and using that knowledge to form moral, strategic, and systemic judgments. Sapience is an inherent, that is genetically mediated, capacity of brains that have greater processing power in key regions of the prefrontal cortex (Part 4). However, it is not sufficiently well developed in the vast majority of the population, which could explain why humanity is in the mess it is in today. We\'ve made some very unwise choices throughout history. We continue to fail to learn from our past mistakes, both individually and collectively. Our lack of wisdom on both fronts will doom us to make more serious errors in the future. It could possibly lead to the extinction of the genus Homo as there are no other representatives of the only talking ape, sapiens. This has been a basic overview of the thesis on sapience. In Part 2 I will begin to delve much deeper into the relationships between sapience and the other constructs that have been studied most heavily by psychology and neuroscience, intelligence, creativity, and affect. This will, hopefully, establish sapience as a real and separate construct (as wisdom) that might be explored by those sciences in its own light. Part 3 will further develop the concepts described here as the components of sapience, judgment, moral sentiment, systems perspective, and strategic perspective. I will attempt to show how these components are derived from general psychological and neurological knowledge. Then, in Part 4 I will explore the specific neurological basis for my claims regarding the nature of sapience. There I will attempt to bring together some of the most recent research on neuroscience, with my own theoretical work on intelligence, creativity, affect, and sapience as it may be realized in actual brain structures and tissues. Finally, in Part 5 I will explore the genetic, developmental, and evolutionary significance of sapience. This will include looking backward at how sapience evolved as a unique human capacity, how it became stunted by cultural evolutionary forces, and then observe some speculations about what might be in the future. This latter subject is motivated by the concern that modern humans are, in fact, inadequately sapient for the very world we have created from our own cleverness. Human beings will need to evolve a greater sapience in order to have a wiser species if there is to be a human presence in the far future of the Earth. Footnotes [1] The term “construct” refers to a set of attributes and functions which can be defined and measured (to some extent) through psychological testing. Other kinds of constructs include personality profiles, thinking styles, etc. I am using the term to index the categories of specific cognitive and affective functions most related to the wisdom. It may be that my use of the term stretches its ordinary psychological meaning. If so I apologize to psychologists who might take issue. [2] The paleocortex is the more ancient part of the cerebral cortex just below the neocortex (the outer rind). It evolved in late reptiles and early mammals to support memory encoding used to modulate purely reactive (affective-based) behaviors. In the modern mammalian brain it is still involved in early memory formations (e.g. the hippocampus). [3] “Cybernetics” is the science of control theory. The term ‘control’ carries some unwanted baggage in general parlance, where it can mean ‘command and control’ in a very top-down manner. Hierarchical cybernetics is a model that is applicable to complex, autonomous entities like people or organizations. Modern concepts of such entities cause many people to eschew the word control as having a negative connotation. Therefore I choose to use the term cybernetics to help assuage any preconceived notions about what this model has to say.

After my book, Arts for Change, was completed www.artsforchange.org last January, I clearly needed to give the writing part of my brain a rest. Of course, I still wrote dozens of emails almost everyday, but publishing something for the public to read was not on my agenda. Now that my blog has been linked to Tikkun\'s blog, I feel a responsibility to be present. So here I am. It\'s been a good ride during these past 8 months. The book came out in late Feb and I did readings and signings at various places (LA, Tacoma, NYC, western MA, Olympia, Port Townsend, Oakland and Berkeley). I took the months of July and August \"off\" partly so I could produce a new body of work, \"underGROUND: Artifacts of the Moment\"and it opened at my collective\'s gallery, VALISE on August 7th. http://www.valisegallery.org/Valise/Aug09show.html I \"danced\" through the creation of those pieces in the space of 28 days. It was quite the whirlwind. I will post some images of the mixed media work and an artist\'s statement sometime today. Otherwise, it\'s time to start new adventures, and wrap my head around some difficult issues (like the mercenary, right-wing armies I heard Jeremy Scahill discuss yesterday on the radio http://odeo.com/episodes/25061031-Blackwater-The-World-s-Most-Deadly-Mercenary-Army-An-Interview-w-Jeremy-Scahill. I\'m striving to keep a balance between daily deliciousness and impending doom, as my recent body of work will expose. More soon. Posted by still sprouting at 9:21 AM No comments: Wednesday, January 28, 2009 Too hot to handle Here\'s a new piece. Originally solicited by a magazine devoted to contemporary Jewish thought and culture to create a work on Feminism and Jewish Identity, I went through my old digital pieces on Jewish cultural identity, and decided to rework an old piece. The old one was about being mistaken for a Palestinian spy at the Algiers airport. I eliminated the text, reworked the image to include an old ad and then added some new imagery in Painter and Photoshop. And the text is new as well. When I sent it in to the magazine editor, I never heard back. I wrote to her three times, and zilch was my response. So, I am sharing it with you. It is inspired by the crisis in Gaza.

The author offers candid examination of her own university teaching career, weaves in broader social and historical perspectives, and opens readers\' minds to other points of view, including those collected from contemporaries in her field. Arts for Change intersperses scholarly concerns with intimate, image-rich metaphor in a free-spirited, non-academic prose. The author answers vital questions that students and educators have long been asking: How can polarized groups work together to solve social and environmental problems? How can art be used to raise consciousness? Using her personal experiences in the classroom as a template, Naidus guides the reader through a progression of steps to help students observe the world around them and craft artistic responses to what they see. Arts for Change also features interviews with over 30 artist/educators with diverse opinions and strategies for successfully engaging students in what, to them, is most meaningful. Illustrated with 48 visuals and photographs of student, faculty and community works, Arts for Change is both inspirational and instructional. It is sure to stimulate new thinking among arts faculty, arts students, and activists of all kinds, as well as anyone who has an inkling of the role the arts can play in responding to critical issues of the day. Bevery Naidus’ warm and serious pedagogic memoir should ring bells with educators everywhere. I have long admired her commitment to an alternative path in teaching art and social justice without contradictions. Her personal and political odyssey, and the thumbnail portraits of her artist colleagues/mentors, offer an illuminating glimpse beyond the academic curtain. – Lucy R.

Posted by still sprouting at 8:47 AM 1 comment: Thursday, January 01, 2009 a new year, a fresh start, a moment of peaceful reflection I am sitting in my studio on a thursday morning, this new year\'s day 2009, watching the rain dribble down on the remains of the big blizzard of 2008. I\'ve been hesitating to write for weeks, wanting to give my muse a break, and feeling a bit shy of this public broadcast of my used-to-be journaled, private thoughts. But I want to start making things: objects and images, and I feel this need to pour out the words that might be clogging up the pipes. I had this sense that I am waking up from a long sleep. It\'s true that it\'s not the first time this has happened, but right now it is profound. My dreams refer to this, as does the way that impressions of the world are hitting me, cracking habitual patterns of response, and making me pause. I think this might happen when people finish books, or when changes push one\'s expectations into new realms. Or maybe it\'s the pull of the planets. I honestly don\'t know. Ah, but I sense I am being too abstract here. I am looking out the window at lush, thick moss coating an old snag and I feel some sort of identification with it - like there are seeds hiding in this old bark just waiting for the right climate to sprout. There\'s more to say...but my fingers are growing restless for something other than keypads...to be continued. Posted by still sprouting at 9:14 AM No comments: Sunday, December 21, 2008 Global Orgasm Day - Happy Solstice Almost forgot to announce that today and tonight are Global Orgasm Day (according to some folks in Finland who came up with this and announced it on FB). I hope you will do your part for world peace. We\'ve done ours. Posted by still sprouting at 1:32 PM No comments: snow crusted into stillness So, unofficially it\'s been said that this is the worst \"blizzard\" since 1948. I put blizzard in quotes, because without wind and whiteouts, this is really just a freakish snow storm, with occasional icy rain, and intense cold, and lots of snow (over a foot now). I feel like we live in the Alps or somewhere equally remote, but without shovels or plows or anything resembling the capability to deal with all of this. I plan to spend the rest of the day making latkes for neighbors who will be sliding down the hill or up, and curried coconut squash soup. The meringues are already made. As is the raw cranberry, apple and nut relish. After everyone leaves, I will organize my office and start writing a short paper for a conference. I want to write about this moment we are living in, one of great uncertainty and fear, as well as one of enormous potential. I\'ve been doing an inordinate amount of web surfing and gleaning things from various sites that I hope to share soon. Tomorrow looks like another day without mobility, so I am hopeful that the muse will arrive to guide me. Posted by still sprouting at 10:37 AM No comments: Sunday, November 16, 2008 After a Blissful Hike, Some Time in the Studio It\'s a day of gratitude. Having come through so many health and emotional crises this year, we have found ourselves on a gentle plateau looking out at the vista. Bob and I took an impromptu hike down our hill with the intention of finding salmon leaping in our local creek (one of two creeks in the south Puget Sound that is unobstructed and allows salmon to jump up it). The water was too low, but we did find a new trail, a gift from the Land Trust. It took us across the creek and then up through meadows unlike any I\'ve seen locally. We both felt transported to upstate NY or Vermont. It was truly a delight, with all the late autumn colors and birds of all sorts were stirred up by our arrival. I am now determined to add this hike to my normal one - up the hill, following the trails of the equestrian park. Now I am in the studio contemplating my next projects for the first time in a long while. The marathon of writing the book is over, and the next steps for its production are mostly out of my hands, so my brain is beginning to ease into another chapter. It is a chapter influenced by tightening already tight budgets, and figuring out priorities. The first steps must be organized towards writing grants to support my sabbatical projects - an eco-art piece on Vashon, and researching community-based, socially engaged art in South America. I want to build networks abroad with all sorts of people involved in this work. Whether the funding will arrive for both pieces is unclear, but I am putting the energy out to make it possible. The eco-art piece may deal with the former use of the equestrian park - Paradise Ridge once housed missile silos armed with nukes - it was a NIKE base 1956-74, and there is evidence that during those later years the missiles were from the Hercules series and armed with nuclear weapons. For someone who has done lots of work on nuclear nightmares, and who had her thyroid gland removed due to cancer caused by radiation, this is something significant to contemplate and make art about. Nuked Notes could resurrect itself as a site-specific project easily accessible on the local trails as well as an artist\'s book. We will see. Another project is a gardening piece - a remediation art project for the Beall greenhouses in the center of the island. The garden will be filled with altars and signage, and have interactive parts. I am excited about all of this. I feel privileged to have the time and resources to even meditate about these possibilities. I hope my health continues to stay in an even keel so that I can pursue all of them. Posted by still sprouting at 1:42 PM No comments: Wednesday, November 05, 2008 It\'s OOOOOOO-Day dear friends - I can barely focus today because I\'ve been reading voraciously - emails from all over the world, appraisals of this moment written by various great minds and spirits, some well known and some as yet unsung. Last night was one of rapture, surrounded by hundreds of islanders, many of whom have worked for social change for so many decades, very rarely getting to see a victory so splendid as this one. I was so grateful to be there, hugging crying people, yelping for joy with each new result visible on the large projection screens. Many people remarked that it was like vanquishing the Nazis, as D-Day might have felt. We called it OOOOO-Day, and raised our fists in solidarity and danced and spread our \"congratulations\" around the room. My son was there, and at age 13, after all the troubles he\'s witnessed in his short life, I was so elated to see his face light up with the pleasure of seeing something truly good happen. He hugged people freely and bounced on his feet - wow, a chance to see the world as something beyond disappointing - it was the youth who were a large part of what made it happen. The crowd danced and carried on til late in the night, occasionally pausing to weep with the people they saw in Grant Park. I came home to feast on blogs from friends, current students and former ones, Facebook and images of this new day, and a sense of possibility pouring in from around the world. Check out the slide show here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ We still have many nightmares to unravel, and that will take years, probably decades, to sort through - we need to relish this moment of joy and it will hopefully sustain us. Check out this beautiful editorial from the NY Times and the blogged responses that follow - very refreshing and grounded people (mostly). http://planetwaves.net/pagetwo/2008/11/05/the-next-president/ and then read Michael Moore\'s view of the moment: http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?id=240 Posted by still sprouting at 1:55 PM 1 comment: Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom) Blog Archive Blog Archive September (2) January (3) December (2) November (4) October (2) September (4) August (4) July (26) June (20) May (1) October (4) September (1) June (2) May (3)  '),(258,'You do not have Javascript turned on, please click the button to continue.'),(259,'This is the web page for A.

It\'s quite a change from my previous position as Executive Director for the Association for Women in Mathematics (2005-2007). During that time I had the privilege to occasionally teach for the University of Puget Sound  and Pacific Lutheran University. For more than twelve years, I taught at Occidental College in the Mathematics Department where I was promoted to full professor and served as Department Chair.  For more information about me, follow the link of your choice: Current Course Materials I served as co-editor of Math Horizons a magazine for math enthusiasts of all ages published by the Mathematical Association of America from 2004-2008. What a fantastic experience.  I was honored to receive one of three Mathematical Association of America\'s Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics at the 2007 Joint Mathematics Meetings in New Orleans. My book Proofs that Really Count: The Art of Combinatorial Proof  (co-authored with Arthur Benjamin) was awarded the 2006 MAA Beckenbach Book Prize at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Antonio. The on-line presentation from MathFest 2003 of the same name is available. My acceptance speech for the Graham L. Sterling Award at Occidental\'s 2005 Convocation has caused quite a stir. The text is available for those who missed it or would like to refresh their memories. I also started an FAQ to answer the many queries from students, parents, and others. Additionally, I have posted a copy of the editorial for the Occidental Weekly that I wrote in response to a request from its editor. Publication list. Personal information.

Press Release Posted Oct 6, 2014, 5:18 PM by AWM Web Editor People\'s Climate March The AWM endorses the People’s Climate March on September 21st in New York City in support of the UN Climate Summit\'s goal of achieving an ambitious global agreement to dramatically reduce global warming pollution.  The march is \"centered on justice: committed to principles of environmental justice and equality.\" We encourage you to join the March in New York City or another event in your region. The preponderance of published evidence points toward human contributions to global climate change and the logical conclusion is that action is needed to lower risks and costs.

Award-Winning Articles The Trevor Evans Awards, established by the Board of Governors in 1992 and first awarded in 1996, are presented by the Mathematical Association of America to authors of exceptional articles that are accessible to undergraduates and published in Math Horizons. The awards are named for Trevor Evans, a distinguished mathematician, teacher and writer at Emory University. The award is $250. See past winners. Information for Authors Math Horizons is intended primarily for undergraduates interested in mathematics. Thus, while we especially value and desire to publish high-quality exposition of beautiful mathematics, we also wish to publish lively articles about the culture of mathematics. We interpret this quite broadly: We welcome stories of mathematical people, the history of an idea or circle of ideas, applications, fiction, folklore, traditions, institutions, humor, puzzles, games, book reviews, student math club activities, and career opportunities and advice. No footnotes please, and while we encourage a suggested reading list at the conclusion of an article, references to essential sources should occur in the text. Manuscripts may be submitted electronically to editor David Richeson (mathhorizons@maa.org). The preferred electronic form is an MS Word document. Text files and LaTeX submissions are also acceptable. If submitting by mail, please send a hard copy to:  David Richeson Department of Mathematics and Computer Science Dickinson College P.O.

C. L. (2003). Eyewitness accuracy rates in police showup and lineup presentations: A meta-analytic comparison. Law and Human Behavior, 27(5), 523-540.).  This research, however, only looked at one aspect of showups that was believed to be suggestive by the courts; lack of protection.  In comparison to lineups, showups offer no protection to an innocent suspect when he/she is presented to an eyewitness that feels compelled to choose anyone.  In a properly constructed lineup, the likelihood of misidentifying an innocent suspect will be equal to 1/k (where k equals the number of individuals presented in the lineup).  In a showup, the likelihood of misidentification by an eyewitness that feels compelled to identify anyone is also 1/k, however k always equals 1 and therefore the likelihood of misidentification is equal to 100% in a situation where the eyewitness feels compelled to pick anyone.  According to the previous research, this \"lack of protection\" does not appear to increase the likelihood of misidentification.  However, drawing ultimate conclusions that showups are more accurate than lineups is troublesome since the research only focused on one specific aspect of showups that was believed to be suggestive by the Courts.  The Courts have also proposed that \"custodial influence\" (the presentation of an individual in the custody of police officers) may be unduly suggestive and therefore bias the eyewitness\' identification.  The present research was designed to assess whether custodial influence increases the likelihood of identification of a suspect in a showup, regardless of whether the suspect is the perpetrator of the crime.  Results of this research suggest that custodial influence increases both the likelihood of identification of a suspect, regardless of guilt or innocence, as well as the confidence the eyewitness has in his/her identification.  A manuscript of this research is currently under review.  Research Team:    Dr. Stephen J. Ross   Examining field/archival research on eyewitness identification procedures (Completed – Manuscript revision)  The recent publications of lineup evaluations from Hennepin County, Minnesota and Illinois have sparked much controversy over the relative effectiveness of sequential and simultaneous lineup procedures.  At the base of this controversy is the contention that field evaluations are highly sensitive to aspects of the study environment and, therefore, researchers must be diligent to ensure that proper field evaluation techniques are being utilized when conducting this research.  However, commentators have overlooked that we now have 10 published reports evaluating eyewitness identification practices in actual police investigations.  These reports provide us with an opportunity to evaluate the influence of various system and estimator variables across time and jurisdiction.  The present examination was conducted to compare, and combine where possible, the results from these studies to determine the influence of specific system and estimator variables on eyewitness identification rates.  Results from this project were presented at the “Off the witness stand” conference at John Jay College in March, 2007 and at annual meeting of the American Psychology-Law Society in Jacksonville, FL in March 2008.  We are currently revising a manuscript and will be resubmitting it for review. Research Team:    Dr. Stephen J. Ross                                 Dr. Roy S. Malpass (University of Texas at El Paso)                                 Understanding the processes behind the Appearance Change Instruction: Criterion shift or mental mutation? (Completed - Manuscript preparation) Prior to viewing a lineup, eyewitnesses are often instructed that the perpetrator’s appearance may not be the same in the lineup as it was during commission of the crime.  Only one published study (Charman & Wells, 2007) has evaluated the efficacy of this “appearance change instruction” (ACI).  Charman and Wells (2007) found that the ACI was actually detrimental to eyewitnesses as it increased the likelihood of a false identification without increasing correct identifications and proposed two theories that may explain the effects the ACI has on eyewitness recognition. First, they proposed that by giving eyewitnesses the ACI prior to the identification task, the witness may be engaging in a form of “mental mutation” in which they are imagining alternatives to the lineup members that are more similar to their memory of the perpetrator and then evaluating whether that “new” stimulus is the perpetrator.  This mutation increases the extent to which the eyewitness’ new stimuli are similar to their original memory of the perpetrator resulting in an increase in “general ecphoric similarity” leading to an increase in choosing rates across both perpetrator-present and perpetrator-absent lineups. The second theory proposed by Charman and Wells (2007), is that the ACI influences eyewitness decisions through a downward criterion shift.  According to this theory, the implication that the perpetrator may not look the same now as he/she did during commission of the crime leads to a lowered decision criterion causing eyewitnesses to be willing to accept less similarity between the lineup member and their memory of the perpetrator as a positive identification.  In this research we are interested in evaluating the cognitive mechanisms through which the ACI influences eyewitness decisions.  We will directly contrast two theories of how the ACI may influence eyewitness decisions as proposed by Charman and Wells (2007).  Specifically, through a series of three studies we will evaluate whether the influence of the ACI on eyewitness decisions appears to be a product of a general increase in ecphoric similarity (due to mental mutation of the original memory with the presented lineup members) or a downward criterion shift.  In Study 1, a process-tracing approach (Ericsson & Simon, 1993) will be used to evaluate the decision processes used by eyewitnesses when given the ACI and compare that with other eyewitnesses not given this instruction.  Study 2 will use a dual-process paradigm (Meissner, Tredoux, Parker, & Maclin, 2005) to evaluate whether the ACI influences criterion placement and familiarity-based responding. Finally, Study 3 will involve a secondary recognition task in which eyewitnesses will be asked to identify previously seen lineup members from a photoarray containing images of those lineup members and various “morphs” of those lineup members with the original perpetrator’s image. Studies 1 and 2 have been completed with results presented at the last two meetings of the American Psychology-Law Society. Data collection on Study 3 is currently underway.  Research Team:    Dr. Stephen J. Ross                                 Brian Cahill (Graduate Assistant - Florida International University)                                 Jenna Kieckhaefer (Graduate Assistant - Florida International University)   Evaluating lineup construction techniques: Similarity structure, lineup fairness, and diagnosticity (Data collection) Research indicates that suspect-filler similarity is associated with lineup fairness such that lineups in which the fillers are more similar to the  suspect are fairer than those that consist of fillers that are dissimilar to the suspect (Malpass & Devine, 1983; Malpass, Tredoux & McQuiston-Surrett, 2005).  In this research we are interested in determining the extent to which the similarity structure of lineups is influenced by the construction technique (match-to-description, match-to-suspect, Wogalter, & Iterative).  In addition, we are evaluating the efficiency of various construction techniques and the fairness & diagnostic value of the lineups developed using these techniques.  In contrast to previous research evaluating similarity structure of lineups, we are using an objective measure of facial similarity derived from a geometric model constructed through principal-components analysis (PCA).  Using this approach, the similarity between any two faces can be estimated by calculating the Euclidian distance between those two faces in the geometric model.  Participants are trained in one of the four construction techniques and are required to construct lineups for four different suspects.  Data for this project is currently being collected.  Analyses will be performed to evaluate whether the similarity structure of the lineup (suspect-filler similarity & inter-filler similarity) varies across the four construction techniques.  In addition, the efficiency of the construction techniques in relation to amount of training required, ease of understanding, and amount of time required for constructing the lineups will be evaluated.  Future data collection will be conducted to evaluate the fairness and diagnostic value of the lineups generated using these techniques.

I invest a lot of time in the students who work with me, and I do not have an unlimited amount of time and energy for this part of my work. Therefore I choose students for the lab very carefully and only accept a handful of undergraduate research assistants each year. During their first quarter as members of the CASCR, students’ volunteer their time spent in the laboratory. After at least one quarter in the lab, students may have the opportunity to earn course credits for their research hours.  New research assistants are required to volunteer 5-7 hours per week in the CASCR. Upon joining the lab, new research assistants will receive an orientation into lab activities and the requirements of being an CASCR lab member (see below for information on requirements of new CASCR research assistants).  During the first quarter, research assistants will primarily work on data collection for ongoing CASCR studies; however, as research assistants gain more knowledge and experience their opportunities will increase. Many advanced research assistants have the opportunity to assist with data analyses, conference presentations, manuscript preparation, and project development.     As I have a limited number of research assistant opportunities, competition is typically strong.  Acceptance of new students into the CASCR is based upon availability, degree progress, and academic merit.  Here are some of the criteria I apply: It is best if beginning lab members have at least one full academic year left before graduation (and preferably at least 6 quarters), so they can receive some training and have time to develop their own  project. However, research needs sometimes provide opportunities for students with less time until graduation and who do not necessarily want to develop their own project. Undergrads in the lab must have a GPA of at least 3.0 (3.5 or better is desirable). The workload can become fairly heavy at times, because projects have their own pace and the people need to keep up. In order to get the background information required and also participate in the research, lab members have to do well in conventional student tasks. While I prefer accepting students with at least a 3.0 GPA (for the above stated reasons), students with a GPA below the 3.0 cutoff will be considered on a case?by?case basis. Preference is given to students that have completed TMATH 110 (or another statistics course) and TPSYCH 209 (or equivalent research methods course) and have earned at least a \"B\" in these courses. Applicants that have yet to complete these courses or have completed these courses with grades below \"B\" will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  If you would like more information about the CASCR and/or research opportunities, feel free to contact me (Dr. Ross) @ (253) 682-4386 or via e-mail.  Students interested in joining the CASCR must complete an application and return it to me either by dropping it by my office (MDS 104E) or attaching it to an e-mail. Following a review of the application, students will be contacted to arrange a time for an interview.   Welcome to the CASCR….Now what? Information for New CASCR Research Assistants 1. Lab Requirements All information regarding the lab requirements for new RA\'s can be found in the lab syllabus.  Briefly, an RA’s duties in the lab may include but are not limited to: ·         attend training sessions / lab meetings ·         stimulus creation ·         data entry ·         running experimental sessions ·         interacting with participants ·         coding data While the number of hours worked is somewhat negotiable and may vary throughout the semester depending upon such things as the number of projects we have running or the number of participants signing up, I expect RA\'s to work approximately 5-7 hours per week in the lab. 2. Human Participants Training Individuals conducting research with human participants are required to undergo training to ensure the safety of the research participants.  All members of the CASCR are required to complete the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) on-line tutorial on Protecting Human Research Subjects. (http://www.citiprogram.org/) This tutorial must be completed within the first week of joining the lab. Once completed, you must provide me (Dr. Ross) with a photocopy of Certificate of Completion to keep on file in the lab. More information on the federal regulations and PHRS training is available at the UW Human Subjects Division website (http://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/).   3. Getting Familiarized with Our Research I have developed a list of readings related to research in the areas of eyewitness psychology and decision-making in criminal investigations. This list and the accompanying readings will be provided to new RAs via e-mail and on a CD entitled “Starting out in the CASCR”. These readings provide background knowledge about our areas of research and all new RAs are expected to familiarize themselves with these articles within the first couple weeks they are a members of the lab.     I want to go to grad school….What do I need to do?? Information on Prepping for Grad School and Other Undergraduate Resources  Preparing for Graduate School Most students who join the CASCR are interested in pursuing graduate education in psychology or a related field.  Typically, students that are interested in pursuing graduate training should begin preparing for graduate school during their Sophomore year of undergraduate education, and no later than the beginning of their Junior year, as preparing for graduate school requires a lot of time and effort.  The American Psychological Association (APA) offers A Guide to Getting Into Graduate School on their website.  This guide provides useful information on preparing for graduate school and references to other informative resources.  Additionally, Dr. Ross has presented a seminar providing undergraduates with information on preparing for graduate school.  The .ppt corresponding to Dr. Ross\' seminar on What you need to do as an undergraduate to get into graduate school is available here.  Below is a list of additional resources that will assist you with preparing for graduate school as an undergraduate here @ UWT.

Zent, M.S. Class Times: Thursdays 2:00-4:05 pm Office Hours: By appointment Office: DOU #410 Office Phone: 692-5630(message only) Fax: 692-4523 E-Mail: ezent@u.washington.edu Course Description Specific Course Objectives Course Format, Structure and Procedures Grading Procedures Expectations Course Description The ability to communicate effectively in writing is one of the most important skills for educational and career success. TBGEN 311 is designed to improve your understanding and application of techn iques and skills in professional and academic writing. It is meant to help students of all levels of experience and skill improve their writing in various formats, including letters, memos, reports and essays. The primary goal of this course, then, is twofold: (a) to provide students with practical information about the essentials of writing that can be applied to both academic and professional contexts; and (b) to improve students \' writing skills by providing frequent opportunities for practice in the various components of writing. TBGEN 311 will cover information about writing from the prewriting stages of planning and organization through actual writing, and revision and editing. The course is organized around the actual steps and components of the writing process. The order in which the material is covered in this course will model the sequence of steps one would follow in actual practice when faced with a writing task. Thus, we will begin with prewriting techniques that will help you sharpen and refine your writing object ives. Next, we will cover principles of organization that will help you arrange and structure information effectively to meet your specific writing objectives. We will then move to the basics of actual composition, including sentence and paragraph const ruction, that will help you write in coherent and grammatically correct form. Finally, we will cover revising, editing and proofreading techniques that will help you improve the overall quality of the documents you prepare. Specific Course Objectives Upon completion of TBGEN 311 you should be able to: Understand and effectively apply the steps in the writing process. Write coherent and grammatically correct sentences. Write unified, coherent, adequately developed paragraphs. Adapt writing goals and styles to various audiences to achieve appropriate writing style and content. Understand and apply the principles of organization to effectively outline information and ideas. Use editing and revising techniques to improve writing quality. Understand and apply connecting devices to enhance document clarity, unity and coherence. Course Format, Structure and Procedures TBGEN 311 has been prepared using an on-line format that will allow students to access course materials remotely. We will meet in the classroom once a week. D uring each session, we will discuss materials corresponding to that week\'s subject matter (see \"Course Outline and Schedule\"). In each classroom session we will cover the most important informational content on the given topic for that week. Students wi ll then be given the remaining class time to work on exercises corresponding to the week\'s particular topic (see \"Course Activities and Assignments\"). Students are required to review course materials (see \"Instructional Materials\") prior to each week\'s class session. The outline of weekly topics can be found in \"Course Outline and Schedu le.\" We will discuss these materials in class and you will be asked to offer input about them. Following each session, students are required to complete the corresponding \"Activities and Assignments\" (available only on this web site) and submit them in class during the next week\'s session. NOTE: It is each student\'s responsibility to complete and submit the activities and assignments on this web site. These assignments WILL NOT be available in any other format, so st udents must be proactive about accessing, completing and turning in the assignments using this on-line format. Grading Procedures This course will be graded using a \"pass-fail\" format. There are two requirements for passing the course: (1) students must adequately complete the assignments and activities required for each giv en week; and (2) students must pass a post-course assessment which will evaluate competency in each of the areas covered in the course. Inadequate performance in any of these three areas will constitute a failing grade in this course. Expectations (1) The course will be discussion-oriented and collaborative in nature. In class I will provide an overview of course materials, but I will also ask you for questions, ideas and examples. (2) We will cover a broad spectrum of material in a short period of time. Therefore, it is vital that you keep up on the assigned instructional materials, be prepared to discuss materials in class, and plan ahead to complete the assignments and activ ities. The \"Course Outline and Schedule\" provides a breakdown of each weekly topic. (3) I will do my best to create a comfortable, productive environment. I only ask that you show respect for me and your fellow students by being prompt, coming to class prepared, listening to others without interruption, and constructively participat ing in class discussions and activities. (4) All activities and assignments should be submitted in professional, type written form. Each set of assignments is due in class one week after we have discussed the instructional materials for that particular topic. For example, we will be discussing Document Planning and Writing Purpose Statements in class during Week 2, and you should submit the activities and assignments for Document Planning and Writing Purpose Statements Week 3. (see \"Course Activities and Assignments\"). (5) All of the class sessions, instructional materials, and activities and assignments are designed with the sole purpose of helping you improve your writing skills. Students who actively participate in the course should feel confident in their abilit y to pass the post-course assessment. (6) All students are expected to do their own work in this class. Additionally, plagiarism in any form will not be tolerated. Examples or plagiarism include, but are not limited to, the failure to cite references appropriately and \"double dipping\" (submitting your own work as original when it has been submitted to fulfill other course objectives.) (7) In the event of inclement weather, the most efficient ways to receive information about class cancellation or campus closure are to: (1) call 383-INFO; or (2) check your email for messages from me or check UWTBIZ.

Friday, April 15, 2011 Ford Motor Company Event Friday – April 8, 2011 From: 11:30 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. Thanks to our former MS student, Talia Selitsky, and a current employee of Ford, we had a fantastic visit at Ford Motor Company. The Ford field trip provided an opportunity to: • Tour the Ford Motor Credit Company data warehousing center – Along with the tour of the center, the opportunity to enter into the environmental infrastructure support rooms (Uninterruptible Power Supply or UPS, the associated batteries, chillers, pumps etc.) • Speak with Ford IT recruiters • Meet/Greet with Maria Flores, responsible for IT Infrastructure Operations in the Canada, Mexico and South America (CMSA) region in Ford Motor Company. As of 2009, Maria is also responsible for the Global Digital Worker Program. Within CMSA, she is involved in numerous global strategic initiatives including Data Center Consolidation, Network Upgrades, IP Telphony Deployment, and Global Help Desk. Her organization is also supporting all infrastructure needs of new plants and business growth. Her responsibility for the Global Digital Worker Program for Ford, encompasses deployment of the tools for employee collaboration and productivity globally. This program is transforming the workplace within Ford Motor Company. In addition, we ate a yummy lunch at a local Middle Eastern restaurant, Ollie, and mingled with Ford IT personnel. And, did I mention the goodies :) Posted by Monika Witoslawski at 4:58 PM No comments: Thursday, April 7, 2011 MICWIC 2011 Here goes Amber\'s report on MICWIC. She didn\'t say anything about her and Charnique running the CS unplugged games - they did an awesome job, too! A few of the ACM-W members attended MICWIC this year and it was awesome. The conference started out with registration in which we received a nice little package compliments of the sponsors of the conference. Then each of the poster board contestants set up for the judging and allowed for everyone to view and converse with them about their projects. After that we heard remarks from the conference chair, Fatma Mili, about what to expect and what she hopes we will get out of the conference. Then everyone mingled at dinner and we were introduced to the keynote speaker, Jennifer Marsman from Microsoft, who talked to us about the different reasons why technology rocks. After that everyone had a chance to go off to different birds of a feather discussion groups that introduced different issues that women encounter in the computer science field. To finish off the first night there was a short CS unplugged game session back at the hotel which allowed for the students, professors, committee members, and company representatives to mingle in an informal setting. We played three different rounds of the binary game. Each player was given four stacks of five bit cards. The first round allowed for the players to see the five bit cards for each stack. Numbers were called aloud and they had to flip the card over to match the numbers. Then second round, they had to flip that cards over and guess how to make the numbers that were called out aloud. The third round they were given five green and five yellow cards that represented on and off bits respectively. When they number was called out they had to remember how to turn off certain bits to make the number. We played a couple of times for each round to allow for others to win and get used to the game. At the end of the night everyone had a great time and was given it buttons for participating. The next day we had a plenary session about computing in our future given by the session chair, Linda Ott from MTU. Then we broke out into paper and panel session that allowed for people who couldn’t make it the first day to still enjoy some of the intriguing discussions. There was also a career fair that allowed for student and prospective graduate students to talk to companies and school about their future goals. In the midst of the discussions and the career fair we took a group photo to have a reminder of the great minds of our present and future WOMEN computer science majors. Then remarks were made and we all parted back to our homes. Overall the MICWIC 2011 conference was a great learning experience and a great way to learn about the different topics that we can incorporate in to our studies and research. If you missed MICWIC you should try to go to Grace Hopper convention that is November this year in Portland, Oregon. Posted by Monika Witoslawski at 9:35 AM No comments: Sunday, February 27, 2011 OCWIC 2011, February 18-19, 2011 A few of us attended Ohio Celebration of Women in Computing which took place in Ashland County, in Mohican Resort and Conference Center. As the organizers put it, OCWIC (say Oh, Quick!) is a low cost, regionally-tailored, professional conference, modeled after the international Grace Hopper Celebration. The goal of the conference is to provide social and professional support for women in computing. We attended a lot of lightning talks, career panels, paper presentations, and learned, learned, learned. But we also enjoyed ourselves. We came back to Detroit reinvigorated, with a reignited passion for anything and everything that is computing related - and this says a lot, given the middle of quite a winter we\'ve had in Michigan this season. Thank you, our Ohio neighbors for welcoming us with open arms and for creating this opportunity (and for all the cool goodies, too :) Posted by Monika Witoslawski at 5:58 PM No comments: Thursday, October 28, 2010 Tea with Fahima On Wed, October 27, Fahima shared with us her experience with the Imagine Cup competition, including her team\'s national finals in Washington, D.C.

Given the nature of such events - the short amount of time and the great number of participants - it is important to understand how to network and what makes a person stand out among others. This panel, consisting of academic and industry representatives from the greater Detroit area, will discuss the importance and techniques involved in networking and speed interviewing skills.

Inventing the Future and don\'t forget to check out Peter Diamandis\'s Laws for Life quoted below. In the afternoon, a visit to Argonne National Lab, coordinated by Monika. Since it is a government facility and some of us were not allowed in at the last moment because of nationality (watch out US government, some of us might pose a serious threat to your secure functioning), we were forced to split into two groups: Chicago walkers and Argonne visitors. Overall, the Chicago trip was incredibly great - touristy, inspiring, educational, you name it! And of course don\'t forget... Peter’s Laws The Creed of the persistent and passionate mind 1. If anything can go wrong, Fix It!!… To hell with Murphy! 2. When given a choice… Take Both!! 3. Multiple projects lead to multiple successes. 4. Start at the top then work your way up. 5. Do it by the book… but be the author! 6. When forced to compromise, ask for more. 7. If it’s worth doing, it’s got to be done right now. 8. If you can’t win, change the rules. 9. If you can’t change the rules, then ignore them. 10. Perfection is not optional. 11. When faced without a challenge, make one. 12. “No” simply means begin again at one level higher 13. Don’t walk when you can run. 14. Bureaucracy is a challenge to be conquered with a righteous attitude, a tolerance for stupidity, and a bulldozer when necessary. 15. When in doubt: THINK! 16. Patience is a virtue, but persistence to the point of success is a blessing. 17. The squeaky wheel gets replaced. 18. The faster you move, the slower time passes, the longer you live. 19. The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself! 20. The ratio of something to nothing is infinite. 21. You get what you incentivize. 22. If you think it is impossible, then it is… for you. 23. An expert is someone who can tell you exactly how it can’t be done. 24. The day before something is a breakthrough it’s a crazy idea. 25. If it were easy it would have been done already. 26. Without a target you’ll miss it every time. 27. Bullshit walks, hardware talks. 28. A crisis is a terrible thing to waste. 29. The world’s most precious resource is the passionate and committed human mind. 30. If you can\'t measure it, you can\'t improve it.

However, all too often resulting technologies are technically usable, yet cannot be immediately put to meaningful use by users in their local, concrete contexts. Support for concrete user activities is frequently missing in design, as support for decontextualized actions is typically the focus of design. Sun examines this disconnect between action and meaning in cross-cultural technology design and presents an innovative framework, Culturally Localized User Experience (CLUE), to tackle this problem. Incorporating key concepts and methods from activity theory, British cultural studies, and rhetorical genre theory, the CLUE approach integrates action and meaning through a dialogical, cyclical design process to design technology that engages local users within culturally meaningful social practices. Illustrated with five in-depth case studies of mobile text messaging use by college students and young professionals in American and Chinese contexts spanning years, Sun demonstrates that a technology created for culturally localized user experience mediates both instrumental practices and social meanings. She calls for a change in cross-cultural design practices from simply applying cultural conventions in design to engaging with social affordances based on a rich understanding of meaningful contextualized activity. Meanwhile, the vivid user stories at sites of technology-in-use show the power of \"user localization\" in connecting design and use, which Sun believes is essential for the success of an emerging technology like mobile messaging in an era of participatory culture. This book will be of interest to researchers, students, practitioners, and anyone who wants to create culture-sensitive technology in this increasingly globalized world that requires advanced strategies and techniques for culturally localized, participatory design.

However, all too often resulting technologies are technically usable, yet cannot be immediately put to meaningful use by users in their local, concrete contexts. Support for concrete user activities is frequently missing in design, as support for decontextualized actions is typically the focus of design. Sun examines this disconnect between action and meaning in cross-cultural technology design and presents an innovative framework, Culturally Localized User Experience (CLUE), to tackle this problem. Incorporating key concepts and methods from activity theory, British cultural studies, and rhetorical genre theory, the CLUE approach integrates action and meaning through a dialogical, cyclical design process to design technology that engages local users within culturally meaningful social practices. Illustrated with five in-depth case studies of mobile text messaging use by college students and young professionals in American and Chinese contexts spanning years, Sun demonstrates that a technology created for culturally localized user experience mediates both instrumental practices and social meanings. She calls for a change in cross-cultural design practices from simply applying cultural conventions in design to engaging with social affordances based on a rich understanding of meaningful contextualized activity. Meanwhile, the vivid user stories at sites of technology-in-use show the power of \"user localization\" in connecting design and use, which Sun believes is essential for the success of an emerging technology like mobile messaging in an era of participatory culture. This book will be of interest to researchers, students, practitioners, and anyone who wants to create culture-sensitive technology in this increasingly globalized world that requires advanced strategies and techniques for culturally localized, participatory design.

There aren’t many websites, online services, or apps that don’t cross at least a few cultural or national boundaries. Even websites intended for a local audience can be used by anyone around the world and adapted for local use by people in different contexts and cultures. This creates a design challenge that is difficult to solve with a few guidelines and patterns. In Cross-Cultural Technology Design, Huatong Sun takes a broader view by examining the challenge of understanding cultural expectations and local context. This is not a how-to book offering guidelines and tips. It is (as Sun says in the preface) a scholarly work, primarily intended for an academic audience; however, it’s well worth the time of any practitioner interested in cultural issues in design. If you are intrigued by contemporary theoretical debates, the first section of the book is a review of the theoretical underpinnings of Sun’s work, including activity theory, British cultural studies, and genre theory. If you are more comfortable with the concrete, start with the middle section, “Experiences,” which contains five stories of how people use mobile communications. These case histories are rich with detailed observations collected over several years. They include Sophie, an American business professional; Lili, a Chinese teacher; Brian, an American graduate student; Mei, a Chinese graduate student; and Emma, an American college student. Their stories carefully unpack the way their social and cultural context affects their user experience of using text messaging in different ways, including how, when, why, and with whom they choose to communicate. Each story ends with the author’s reflections on what the case study reveals about cross-cultural design. Instead of deriving design rules from these case studies, Sun offers a framework for a design philosophy for making technology usable and meaningful to culturally diverse users. The framework, Culturally Localized User Experience (CLUE), emphasizes the need to integrate understanding of the different ways we experience technology as both actions and interpretation: Local culture is an ever-changing context made up of both practices and meanings. User experience includes both activity (situated in a context) and the meaning we assign to or construct for that activity. Design is both problem solving and engaged conversation. Technology is a tool to produce something and a means of communication due to what our choice of technology conveys. Affordance includes the physical design, the interaction, and the social meaning. How people use technology, and what that technology means to them, is an ongoing conversation through which people make sense of their world. Culture is dynamic and constantly evolving, with local culture in dialog with global influences. Design must start from a full understanding of the local context and then integrate it into a larger, global view. Do not let the somewhat academic tone of this book put you off. If you are wrestling with the challenge of global UX, this book is a thoughtful exploration of the intersection of global and local, of activity and meaning. Thinking globally, Sun suggests, requires both meanings of the word global: thinking of the different context and cultures around the world and thinking about a holistic overview in the design process.

However, all too often resulting technologies are technically usable, yet cannot be immediately put to meaningful use by users in their local, concrete contexts. Support for concrete user activities is frequently missing in design, as support for decontextualized actions is typically the focus of design. Sun examines this disconnect between action and meaning in cross-cultural technology design and presents an innovative framework, Culturally Localized User Experience (CLUE), to tackle this problem. Incorporating key concepts and methods from activity theory, British cultural studies, and rhetorical genre theory, the CLUE approach integrates action and meaning through a dialogical, cyclical design process to design technology that engages local users within culturally meaningful social practices. Illustrated with five in-depth case studies of mobile text messaging use by college students and young professionals in American and Chinese contexts spanning years, Sun demonstrates that a technology created for culturally localized user experience mediates both instrumental practices and social meanings. She calls for a change in cross-cultural design practices from simply applying cultural conventions in design to engaging with social affordances based on a rich understanding of meaningful contextualized activity. Meanwhile, the vivid user stories at sites of technology-in-use show the power of \"user localization\" in connecting design and use, which Sun believes is essential for the success of an emerging technology like mobile messaging in an era of participatory culture. This book will be of interest to researchers, students, practitioners, and anyone who wants to create culture-sensitive technology in this increasingly globalized world that requires advanced strategies and techniques for culturally localized, participatory design.

Recent Events Please join us in congratulating Yiru Li, Sarah George, Craig Apfelbeck, Abdeltawab Hendawi, David Hazel, Ankur Teredesai and Mohamed Ali on winning the \"Best Demo\" award at the ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS Conference 2014  on the iTornado system. The paper is titled: “Routing Service With Real World Severe Weather” and presents a framework for routing services to evacuate vehicles under real world severe weather threats. The system is able to: (1) Identify the users inside the dangerous region of a severe weather event, (2) Recommend an evacuation route to guide the users out to a safe destination or shelter, (3) Assure the recommended route to be one of the shortest paths after excluding the risky area, and  (4) Maintain the flow of traffic by normalizing the evacuation on the possible safe routes. For additional information, please visit the Geospatial Data Management page of the Center for Data Science: http://cwds.uw.edu/geospatial-data-management” Dr. George Mobus, Associate Professor in Computer Science & Systems and Computer Engineering & Systems, has just had his textbook (along with co-author Professor Emeritus Michael Kalton of IAS) entitled Principles of Systems Science published by Springer, New York. This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. The book contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. Please join us in congratulating Dr. Mobus on this major accomplishment.

I am most interested in how institutions (or groups of people) set up norms about what makes a person \"good\" or \"healthy\" and how people respond when talking back or sharing stories that shed a light on personal reflection. The common thread that ties my scholarship and teaching together is an interest in transformation and problems generated by the dynamic nature of language, technology, and societal ideological formations. My current research agenda focuses on how language acts upon people, and conversely, how people take up and utilize language to do things, especially in relation to notions of mental health and identity, both individually and institutionally.Broadly defined, my scholarship looks at how language is wielded online in ways that alters ideologies in slow and subtle ways that do not appear transformative on the surface. Through teaching, I provide students with tools to evaluate and employ language effectively. Specifically, I teach students how to critically read not only academic texts but also texts circulating in their everyday world, and provide them with tools to analyze written and spoken language so they may use it persuasively across the constantly changing rhetorical situations they may face. My scholarship on teaching and learning looks to answer questions about how technological changes influence how students write in and out of the classroom, and whether these arenas affect each other.       BURNING QUESTIONS How do people influence others through language? How do people construct & represent self through story & Visual Imagery? How is digital technology Transforming the way people communicate & Connect?

Students do not learn much just by sitting in class listening to teachers, memorizing prepackaged assignments, and spitting out answers. They must talk about what they are learning, write about it, relate it to past experiences, apply it to their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of themselves.”          --Arthur W. Chickering and Zelda F. Gamson, \"Seven Principles for Good Practice\" Teaching and learning for me are intricately interwoven; understanding my philosophy of teaching is coupled with understanding my philosophy on learning. I teach because I love learning. I approach each teaching situation as an opportunity for me and my students to learn. I look to the classroom as a unique learning environment where questions can be raised and answers sought. On the first day of class and in my syllabi, I position the classroom as a learning community in which thoughtful participation and active involvement is expected. For me, teaching is not simply conveying subject matter to my students, but rather providing opportunities for students to engage ideas in relevant and useful ways. I use the classroom as a forum to pose questions that push students to think critically about the issues that are important to them and bring them into intellectual dialogue with others. I rely on a problem-posing pedagogical model wherein I present an educational task, generate and address critical questions, draw attention to possible resources, and offer individualized mentoring while students are involved in self-discovery. I strive to create the exigency that allows students to make their own connections and improve on their own practices.   Inquiry and dialogue are foundational to my pedagogical practice. Because I believe that individuals learn best when they are interested in discovering answers to personally relevant questions, my teaching relies on active learning strategies. As an advocate for active learning, I look to the classroom as a social space where ideas can be shared and different points of view can be discussed. In order to facilitate an environment that is conducive to active learning I situate the course as one that relies on social interaction and collaborative learning. Allowing student interests to guide classroom topics can often be unsettling and seem disjointed; however, by allowing the flexibility to meet student-driven inquiry, classes are often more interesting, more relevant, and more rewarding to both the instructor and the students. I encourage students to work together both as co-investigators and as critics in considering the on-going discussion and the audience’s reception of their ideas and writing. My hope is that when my students leave my class they will use the types of inquiry that that we used in the classroom to engage issues in their daily lives, actively participating in their own educational and life learning. My method of teaching is best described as \"just in time\" teaching.         UWT COURSES TCORE 101 - INTRODUCTION TO COMPOSITION Being digital: All about m/e-stories M/e-stories!

As students spend hours a day using digital technologies to email, text, and facebook friends, the importance of research about how students integrate their knowledge (or lack thereof) into college-writing situations is invaluable. I am currently working on a composition studies project Writing in the Web 2.0 World to learn more about digital literary to develop pedagogical strategies to enhance teaching composition with technology.   COMPUTERS & COMPOSITION Writing & Technology \"Compositionists have attempted to move beyond a binary view of technology access in examining the digital divide and in doing so have raised important questions about the larger societal issues connected to issues of technological literacy and access. While much attention has been paid to students at risk of growing up without access to, and experience with, computers, attention also needs to be paid to students’ critical digital literacies. \" Stephanie Vie - \"Digital Divide 2.0\" What ties this all together? I am intrigued by the power of language to do things in everyday life --such as-- create meaning convey values and beliefs reproduce ideology make sense of problems and empower, control and activate people to take action.           DISCOURSE STUDIES BLOGS Inspired by an interest in transformation and problems generated by the dynamic nature of language, technology, and societal ideological formations, I apply discourse analysis to a mental health website to shed light on how Americans respond to consumer-oriented messages about health and wellness. I am currently working on a number of articles that examine an mental health community website to understand how “wellness” and \"disorder\"are constructed as an ideal to pursue i and correspondingly how individuals construct their self-identity in response to mental Health discourse. This project provides much needed research on how people employ the web to work on the Project of the self” and make sense of self-identity in their everyday lives through telling stories.   UWT Teaching Forum @ LetsTalkTeaching.wordpress.com IAS Graduate Studies @ UWTMetaMasters.wordpress.com Rhetoric Studies@ MetaRhetoric.wordpress.com Research & Writing @ DigiRiki.wordpress.com M/e-stories @ VirtuallyRiki.com Art @ LilGirlArt.com Twitter @rikithompson   CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS Language & Power  “My approach to discourse analysis (a version of ‘critical discourse analysis’) is based upon the assumption that language is an irreducible part of social life, dialectically interconnected with other elements of social life, so that social analysis and research always has to take account of language. This means that one productive way of doing social research is through a focus on language, using some form of discourse analysis.” Norman Fairclough - Analyzing Discourse   NARRATIVE ANALYSIS Identity & Storytelling     Narrative is among the most important social resources for creating and maintaining personal identity. Narrative is a significant resource for creating our internal, private sense of self and is all the more a major resource for conveying that self to and negotiating that self with others.\" Charlotte Linde - Life Stories             January 20, 2014            VITA   CURRICULUM VITA          welcome research teaching technology innovation vita         Riki Thompson, Ph.D. EDUCATION PUBLICATIONS PRESENTATIONS TEACHING Download a PDF of Riki Thompson\'s CV   EDUCATION 2007 - Ph.D. English Language and Literature, University of Washington Areas of Specialization: Discourse Analysis, Composition & Rhetoric, Narrative Analysis, Discourse of Trauma & Recovery Dissertation: Virtual Recovery: Governing Mental Health and Self-Improvement Online 2002 - M.A. English Language and Literature, University of Washington 1996 - B.A. English, University of Washington 1996 - B.A. Business Administration, University of Washington PUBLICATIONS Refereed Articles Thompson, R.

Thomas Anderson, Michael Dahlin, 2011-2012, ISBN: 978-0-9856735-1-2 Course Information What to expect from the course Operating systems provide an interface between applications and the underlying hardware as well as services to users. They are used on most modern platforms today - ranging from high-end supercomputers to embedded systems. The goal of this course is to describe and explore the fundamental architectural and algorithmic concepts involved in the design and implementation of modern operating systems. In many ways, this course draws concepts and ideas from every class you\'ve taken thus far in the undergraduate CS curriculum such as data structures, algorithms, and of course computer architecture. More specifically, this course introduces the principles of operating system design. We will introduce OS concepts and then focus on the following core design principles of modern operating systems including: processes, inter-process communication and concurrent programming, scheduling, memory management, file systems, device management, and finally touch on the OS impact of recent multi-core and emerging architectures. Learning Objectives Aside from specific subject domain knowledge (listed below) a primary objective for this course is learning how to think about complex systems and their dynamics. This means representing those systems and reasoning about their behavior. This is not a matter of just learning specific facts or skills. This is a matter of learning how to think critically. Of course we will focus on subjects specific to operating systems, so you will be gaining explicit knowledge about some of the topics within this domain. Upon completion of this course you should be knowledgable in the following areas: Concepts of OS design and operations OS Components and Structure Processes and Threads (kernel, user, and management) Synchronization, Semaphores, Monitors, and Deadlock Scheduling Memory Management Virtual Memory I/O Device Management Filesystems OS principles in the context of Big Data Frameworks   Tentative Schedule Subjects Covered, by week number, with reading assignments. Note that this schedule is subject to change. Change notifications will be mailed to the class mailing list Note: Readings should be done before lecture (except first week). This schedule is tentative and may change as the course develops.  This schedule follows the textbook closely so that, in general, you should always know where we are in the reading by the week number. Additional readings may be assigned as needed.  I will ensure those are posted and known at least a week in advance of the discussion.      Week Topic Text Reading & Resources 0 Introduction to Operating Systems 1 OS structure, kernel space vs. user space Chapters 1 - 2 2 Processes, threads, and concurrency Chapters 3 - 4  3 Multi-programming, multithreaded, synchronization Chapters 5 - 6 4 Scheduling  Chapter 7  5 Scheduling (continued) and mid-term review Mid-term (Wednesday) Chapter 7  6 Intro to Memory Management Chapter 8  7 Caching, Virtual Memory  Chapter 9  8 File systems  Chapter 11 9 Storage Devices, Files, and Directories  Chapters 12 - 13 10 Beyond Traditional Operating Systems  Reading to be assigned 11 Final Exam   Course Policies The following course policies will be observed this quarter. Grades Grading is based on the final number of points that you have at the end of the quarter. Each assignment/project/exam carries some number of points (below) that are added up at the end of the quarter. The final number of points you end up with will be divided by this total to determine your percentage of total. That percentage will be translated into a final decimal point (4.0 max) grade. Exams There will be two exams - a mid-term (100 points) and final covering major conceptual areas of the course (200 points). Projects There will be several projects during this course to familiarize you with the composition of modern operating systems and how to work with an OS.  To ensure you’ve had some experience working with a real OS, we will be using Linux for several of our projects.  You will learn how to build, modify, and test the proper operation of the Linux kernel.  The details of these projects will be posted to the Moodle page for this class shortly. Test make-ups I will give make-up exams only with prior permission or written excuse. Academic Honesty Any attempt to receive credit for work that is not your own is plagiarism. Attempts to hide the lack of contribution for a weak team member will be counted as academic dishonesty. You should feel comfortable discussing topics, including general approaches to assignments, in a collaborative atmosphere. Discussing concepts and methods to be applied to problems is often a tremendous aid to studying. But when it is time to sit down and write down answers or program code, you should work on your own (team\'s). Course Mechanics Lectures Although I expect most of this course to consist of lectures on the topics at hand, I much prefer to discuss the topics as a class. Some of the best classes I\'ve led have been with well-informed, prepared students who come prepared with questions and ready to discuss the trade-offs involved with alternative approaches. While most modern operating systems follow general design guidelines, there are often times when deviation from general principles leads to better performance, accessibility, or user experience. However, to make such trade-offs one must understand what is being compromised. I like to ask a lot of questions to generate discussion based on the material in the book and supplemental readings!! Please read these in advance of class and be prepared to discuss. Please feel free to ask questions and remember the only dumb question is the one that is not asked. If you do miss a class you will need to make arrangements with classmates to obtain notes. I will not provide an \'extra\' lecture for those situations. Course Email List You should already be subscribed to the mailing list, so please check your email regularly for course announcements and other mail from me or other students.

Recent Events Please join us in congratulating Yiru Li, Sarah George, Craig Apfelbeck, Abdeltawab Hendawi, David Hazel, Ankur Teredesai and Mohamed Ali on winning the \"Best Demo\" award at the ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS Conference 2014  on the iTornado system. The paper is titled: “Routing Service With Real World Severe Weather” and presents a framework for routing services to evacuate vehicles under real world severe weather threats. The system is able to: (1) Identify the users inside the dangerous region of a severe weather event, (2) Recommend an evacuation route to guide the users out to a safe destination or shelter, (3) Assure the recommended route to be one of the shortest paths after excluding the risky area, and  (4) Maintain the flow of traffic by normalizing the evacuation on the possible safe routes. For additional information, please visit the Geospatial Data Management page of the Center for Data Science: http://cwds.uw.edu/geospatial-data-management” Dr. George Mobus, Associate Professor in Computer Science & Systems and Computer Engineering & Systems, has just had his textbook (along with co-author Professor Emeritus Michael Kalton of IAS) entitled Principles of Systems Science published by Springer, New York. This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. The book contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. Please join us in congratulating Dr. Mobus on this major accomplishment.

After graduating from Texas A&M in 1995, I spent several years teaching -- or attempting to teach -- economics to young women at Sweet Briar College in Virginia. While the setting was beautiful and the people wonderful, most of the students were much more interested in their horses. So in 2002, after marrying a beautiful woman from Charlottesville, I joined the faculty at the University of Washington, Tacoma. At that time a young talented faculty, under the guidance of Patricia Fandt, had produced an innovative student-oriented program, and I was thrilled to join them and contribute. I’ve come to learn how rare such programs are in academe. These days I spend most of my professional time thinking about how to teach economics. Teaching is one of the most challenging and interesting activities I’ve ever undertaken and, after two decades, I’m just beginning to understand the possibilities. My research agenda surrounds issues in economic history, especially in the old west and the development of financial markets. My weekends are generally spent on the coast where we are slowly, very slowly, restoring a house. When I’m avoiding my restoration tasks, I consume fine scotch and good cigars while I look at views such as the following: ..

After being selected the MBA Teacher of the Year in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 I was “retired” from the MBA program. I would like to thank the many MBA students I’ve had over the years, not only for their contributions to a class but their enthusiasm and support. As for the undergraduate program, is it possible to get a good education? Yes, but it is a challenge and the student will have to plan wisely. If you want to learn how to write, speak, and think -- especially with some quantitative skills -- then I recommend you do a general business degree and take professors that challenge you and add value to their courses. These professors would include Jill Purdy, Kent Nelson, Zoe Barsness, Stephen Norman, and myself. A student who successfully takes these classes will come out with an excellent well rounded education and be more than capable of going into a wide range of professions, including graduate school. In the last few years, Stephen Norman and myself, have mentored two students who have gone on to graduate school, pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics. Sam Wilson is currently completing his dissertation at George Mason University. Brian Beach is in his third ear at the University of Pittsburgh.

INSERT INTO `HtmlText` VALUES (371,'Home page of Ka Yee Yeung I am an Associate Professor in the Institute of Technology at University of Washington - Tacoma, and an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Microbiology at University of Washington - Seattle. My research focuses on the development of machine learning tools and their application to computational biology. My passion is method development for integration of multiple sources of big data. In particular, I am interested in the development of methods to effectively integrate heterogeneous high-throughput data sources in the construction of regulatory networks and the identification of biologically meaningful biomarkers. I am a computer scientist by training (Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Washington - Seattle under the supervision of Larry Ruzzo). My research spans multiple fields, including computational biology, big data analytics, statistics and machine learning. Publications   Software   Data   Teaching   Curriculum vitae Email me Last Update: 11/1/2014 Research Highlights NIH LINCS consortium: I serve as an external data science collaborator on a NIH-funded BD2K-LINCS Perturbation Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC). The NIH LINCS project is generating millions of experiments, measuring the cell\'s response to drug and genetic perturbations. We work with other investigators in the LINCS consortium to develop computational methods and tools to build predictive models of complex diseases and drug responses.   Network inference from diverse genomics data: Interactions among genes and their gene products comprise a regulatory network. The goal of network inference is to generate testable hypotheses of gene-to-gene influences and subsequently design bench experiments to confirm network predictions. In the November 2011 issue of PNAS, Yeung and colleagues presented a methodology to construct gene regulatory networks from time series expression data in yeast, integrating various types of external biological knowledge available from public repositories. We generated microarray data measuring time-dependent gene-expression levels in 95 genotyped yeast segregants subjected to a drug perturbation. Our algorithm is capable of generating feedback loops and we showed that the inferred network recovered existing and novel regulatory relationships. In addition, we generated independent microarray data on selected deletion mutants to prospectively test network predictions. Related work: BMC Systems Biology 2012, BMC Systems Biology 2014 Nov 2013: Our proposal \"Inference of Gene Networks Studying Human Cancers On The Cloud\" won Microsoft\'s Windows Azure for Research Award.   From computational discoveries to translational research: The development of genetic predictors of clinical outcomes contributes to risk assessment in personalized medicine. In collaboration with Dr. Jerry Radich and Dr. Vivian Oehler at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, we aim to develop computational models that can predict patient responses to therapy at diagnosis, which allow us to tailor therapy to individual patients of chonic myeloid leukemia (CML). We have previously applied Bayesian Model Averaging to a gene expression data studying the progression of CML, and identified 6 predictive genes in Blood 2009. Building on this work, we developed a network-driven approach that uses expert knowledge and predicted functional relationships to guide our search for signature genes in the March 2012 issue of Bioinformatics. We showed that our gene signatures of advanced phase CML are predictive of relapse even after adjustment for known risk factors associated with transplant outcomes.   Pattern discovery and feature selection: I have also contributed to the development and application of pattern discovery and feature selection in computational biology, including clustering algorithms and supervised learning methods.Warning: The NCBI web site requires JavaScript to function. more...

Construction of regulatory networks using expression time-series data of a genotyped population. Yeung KY1, Dombek KM, Lo K, Mittler JE, Zhu J, Schadt EE, Bumgarner RE, Raftery AE. Author information 1Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. Abstract The inference of regulatory and biochemical networks from large-scale genomics data is a basic problem in molecular biology. The goal is to generate testable hypotheses of gene-to-gene influences and subsequently to design bench experiments to confirm these network predictions. Coexpression of genes in large-scale gene-expression data implies coregulation and potential gene-gene interactions, but provide little information about the direction of influences. Here, we use both time-series data and genetics data to infer directionality of edges in regulatory networks: time-series data contain information about the chronological order of regulatory events and genetics data allow us to map DNA variations to variations at the RNA level. We generate microarray data measuring time-dependent gene-expression levels in 95 genotyped yeast segregants subjected to a drug perturbation. We develop a Bayesian model averaging regression algorithm that incorporates external information from diverse data types to infer regulatory networks from the time-series and genetics data. Our algorithm is capable of generating feedback loops. We show that our inferred network recovers existing and novel regulatory relationships. Following network construction, we generate independent microarray data on selected deletion mutants to prospectively test network predictions. We demonstrate the potential of our network to discover de novo transcription-factor binding sites. Applying our construction method to previously published data demonstrates that our method is competitive with leading network construction algorithms in the literature.

We used a supervised framework to compute the probabilities of transcriptional regulation by integrating external data sources. Our goal is to infer the parent nodes (regulators) for each gene g in a regression framework. The probabilities computed in the supervised step were used to constrain potential regulators for gene g. Subsequently, a variable selection algorithm (iBMA) was applied to these candidate regulators using the time-series expression data. Specifically, the expression levels of putative regulators at the previous time point were used to predict the expression level of the gene of interest at the current time point.

Integrating external biological knowledge in the construction of regulatory networks from time-series expression data. Lo K1, Raftery AE, Dombek KM, Zhu J, Schadt EE, Bumgarner RE, Yeung KY. Author information 1Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Box 358070, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. Abstract BACKGROUND: Inference about regulatory networks from high-throughput genomics data is of great interest in systems biology. We present a Bayesian approach to infer gene regulatory networks from time series expression data by integrating various types of biological knowledge. RESULTS: We formulate network construction as a series of variable selection problems and use linear regression to model the data. Our method summarizes additional data sources with an informative prior probability distribution over candidate regression models. We extend the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) variable selection method to select regulators in the regression framework. We summarize the external biological knowledge by an informative prior probability distribution over the candidate regression models. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate our method on simulated data and a set of time-series microarray experiments measuring the effect of a drug perturbation on gene expression levels, and show that it outperforms leading regression-based methods in the literature.

Abstract BACKGROUND: Genome-wide time-series data provide a rich set of information for discovering gene regulatory relationships. As genome-wide data for mammalian systems are being generated, it is critical to develop network inference methods that can handle tens of thousands of genes efficiently, provide a systematic framework for the integration of multiple data sources, and yield robust, accurate and compact gene-to-gene relationships. RESULTS: We developed and applied ScanBMA, a Bayesian inference method that incorporates external information to improve the accuracy of the inferred network. In particular, we developed a new strategy to efficiently search the model space, applied data transformations to reduce the effect of spurious relationships, and adopted the g-prior to guide the search for candidate regulators. Our method is highly computationally efficient, thus addressing the scalability issue with network inference. The method is implemented as the ScanBMA function in the networkBMA Bioconductor software package. CONCLUSIONS: We compared ScanBMA to other popular methods using time series yeast data as well as time-series simulated data from the DREAM competition. We found that ScanBMA produced more compact networks with a greater proportion of true positives than the competing methods. Specifically, ScanBMA generally produced more favorable areas under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall curves than other regression-based methods and mutual-information based methods. In addition, ScanBMA is competitive with other network inference methods in terms of running time.

Among the most complex of these environments is the gut mucosa, where trillions of bacteria (the commensal microbiota) coexist with the host in a mutually beneficial equilibrium. Infection with enteric pathogens like Salmonella Typhimurium disrupts this equilibrium by causing intestinal inflammation, a response that suppresses the growth of the commensal microbiota and favors the growth of S. Typhimurium by several mechanisms. Infection with S. Typhimurium results in the upregulation of antimicrobial proteins that inhibit bacterial growth by limiting the availability of essential nutrients, including metal ions, in a process termed “nutritional immunity”. My lab studies the mechanisms by which S. Typhimurium evades nutritional immunity and acquires metal ions in the inflamed gut, allowing this pathogen to successfully compete with the microbiota for these essential nutrients. December 9, 2014, 4:00 PM, HSB T-639 Raul Andino, Ph.D. Professor Microbiology and Immunology University of California San Francisco \"RNA Virus Population Dynamics: Mechanisms of Replication and Adaptation\" Identifying the rules that govern viral evolution and adaptation is a fundamental challenge in virology and is key to understanding viral pathogenesis and spread. The rapid evolution of RNA viruses underlies the emergence of new infectious agents and gives rise to strains that are resistant to antivirals and vaccines. Optimal genomic diversity is required for adaptation, because diversity is required for adaptation but there is a limit to the maximum possible variability of viral genetic information, beyond which the genetic identity is lost and the population is no longer viable. To determine the genetic composition of the population, we have developed a novel sequencing strategy that enables us to detect rare mutational events with unprecedented accuracy. We have collected information on RNA virus population mutation and phenotype distributions. This massive information was used to develop a number of computational tools and mathematical models that provide global information about population structure, mutational and fitness landscape, mutational robustness and their relationship to function and adaptation. Our data define the population structure and its dynamics of an evolving virus population and provides mechanistic information on virus adaptation and pathogenesis. Global fitness maps were then used to identify epistatic interaction networks, which facilitate structure function predictions and uncover viral protein-protein interactions. Examining the effect of temperature and multiplicity of infection on virus proteins and RNA secondary structure provides additional insights into the viral fitness function.               Z<< Prev || Next >>   MICROBIOLOGY TRAINING FACULTY: Select One Roger Bumgarner James Champoux Edward Clark Brad Cookson Lawrence Corey Richard Darveau Michael Emerman Ferric Fang Deborah Fuller Denise Galloway Adam Geballe Pete Greenberg Caroline Harwood Shiu-Lok Hu Keith Jerome Michael Katze Michael Lagunoff John Leigh Mary Lidstrom Maxine Linial Houra Merrikh Sam Miller John Mittler Steve Moseley Joseph Mougous James Mullins Matthew Parsek Lalita Ramakrishnan Nina Salama Ram Samudrala Pradeep Singh Jason Smith Evgeni Sokurenko David Stahl Beth Traxler Joshua Woodward   ABOUT SEATTLE: www.seattle.gov | www. visit seattle.org       Department of Microbiology · University of Washington · Box 357735 · Seattle WA 98195-7735 · phone: (206) 543-5824 · fax: (206) 543-8297 · micro@u.washington.edu      We use cookies to enhance your experience on our website.

Predicting relapse prior to transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia by integrating expert knowledge and expression data K. Y. Yeung1,*, T. A. Gooley2, A. Zhang2, A. E. Raftery3, J. P.

Abstract Motivation: Selecting a small number of signature genes for accurate classification of samples is essential for the development of diagnostic tests. However, many genes are highly correlated in gene expression data, and hence, many possible sets of genes are potential classifiers. Because treatment outcomes are poor in advanced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we hypothesized that expression of classifiers of advanced phase CML when detected in early CML [chronic phase (CP) CML], correlates with subsequent poorer therapeutic outcome. Results: We developed a method that integrates gene expression data with expert knowledge and predicted functional relationships using iterative Bayesian model averaging. Applying our integrated method to CML, we identified small sets of signature genes that are highly predictive of disease phases and that are more robust and stable than using expression data alone. The accuracy of our algorithm was evaluated using cross-validation on the gene expression data. We then tested the hypothesis that gene sets associated with advanced phase CML would predict relapse after allogeneic transplantation in 176 independent CP CML cases. Our gene signatures of advanced phase CML are predictive of relapse even after adjustment for known risk factors associated with transplant outcomes.

Log inWalter L. Ruzzo Professor, Computer Science & Engineering Adjunct Professor, Genome Sciences Joint Member, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Larry Ruzzo, Professor, received a B.S. (in Mathematics) from the California Institute of Technology in 1968, his Ph.D. (Computer Science) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1978, and has been with the University of Washington since 1977. Currently, his principal research project involves the construction and programming of a vaguely parallel computer, consisting of 32 steam-powered Turing machines installed in the basement of Sieg Hall. Of particular interest is the use of triple-expansion bypass valves, coupled to individual governors on each engine, to achieve write-synchronization of the machines. Graduate students have played an important role in the construction and operation of the engine, particularly in stoking the boilers, and advanced undergraduates are occasionally allowed to polish the brass gauges. Originally intended as a general computing engine, restrictions imposed by the Pollution Control and Noise Abatement Boards require that only algorithms running in polynomial time may be used. The project recently suffered another setback when one of Professor Ruzzo\'s graduate students slipped on a mouldering stack of ungraded homework exercises and fell under the write head of one of the machines. Now permanently embossed with a series of 1\'s and 0\'s, the student is suing to have the machine dismantled. When not blowing off steam, he also pursues research in computational biology as part of the CSE department\'s Computational and Synthetic Biology Group , as well as participating in graduate training through the interdisciplinary graduate program in Computational Molecular Biology and, of course, undergraduate and graduate education in Computer Science & Engineering.

The derivation of diagnostic markers of chronic myeloid leukemia progression from microarray data. Oehler VG1, Yeung KY, Choi YE, Bumgarner RE, Raftery AE, Radich JP. Author information 1Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. voehler@u.washington.edu Abstract Currently, limited molecular markers exist that can determine where in the spectrum of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progression an individual patient falls at diagnosis. Gene expression profiles can predict disease and prognosis, but most widely used microarray analytical methods yield lengthy gene candidate lists that are difficult to apply clinically. Consequently, we applied a probabilistic method called Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to a large CML microarray dataset. BMA, a supervised method, considers multiple genes simultaneously and identifies small gene sets. BMA identified 6 genes (NOB1, DDX47, IGSF2, LTB4R, SCARB1, and SLC25A3) that discriminated chronic phase (CP) from blast crisis (BC) CML. In CML, phase labels divide disease progression into discrete states. BMA, however, produces posterior probabilities between 0 and 1 and predicts patients in \"intermediate\" stages. In validation studies of 88 patients, the 6-gene signature discriminated early CP from late CP, accelerated phase, and BC. This distinction between early and late CP is not possible with current classifications, which are based on known duration of disease. BMA is a powerful tool for developing diagnostic tests from microarray data. Because therapeutic outcomes are so closely tied to disease phase, these probabilities can be used to determine a risk-based treatment strategy at diagnosis.

A summary of our overall approach is shown. The merits of BMA include that the model is multivariate and considers multiple biomarkers simultaneously; that the uncertainty of gene selection is accounted for by averaging over multiple good models; that posterior probabilities are generated for all selected genes and models; and that it produces a high predictive accuracy with relatively few genes.

This figure illustrates the membership of the 6 signature genes in the 21 models selected by the iterative BMA algorithm on the CML progression microarray data. The 6 signature genes are shown on the vertical axis, whereas the 21 models are shown in the horizontal axis. The widths of the columns are proportional to the posterior probabilities of the selected models. A red entry indicates that the corresponding gene is included in a given model.

Figure 3 Differential gene expression of the 6-gene signature in patient cases. Heatmaps of the 6-gene signature selected by the iterative BMA algorithm. (A) Heatmap of the gene expression of the 6-gene signature in the training set of CP and BC CML cases using microarray-based gene expression analyses. (B) Heatmap of the gene expression in the test set, also by microarray-based gene expression analyses. This group is made up of AP by cytogenetic criteria only (AP cyto); AP by cytogenetic and blast count criteria (AP); and BC after a return to second CP (BC-rem). Green indicates differentially decreased expression of each gene in each case compared with its expression in a pool of CP patient samples and red indicates differentially increased expression. The more saturated the color, the greater is the degree of differential expression. (C) A graphic depiction of the predicted posterior probability of all patient samples is shown. The samples are represented on the horizontal axis, whereas the predicted probabilities are represented on the vertical axis. For the training data consisting of 72 CP (group 0) and BC (group 1) cases, the average predicted probabilities over 100 cross validation runs are shown. For the test data, composed of 21 patients before allogeneic transplantation, the predicted probabilities of the 6 signature genes averaged over 21 models are shown. This “intermediate phase” test set is composed of group 2 AP by cytogenetic criteria only; group 3 AP by cytogenetic and blast count criteria; and group 4 BC after a return to second CP. For 17 of 21 patients, posttransplantation outcomes were available. Using a posterior probability threshold of 0.3, we found that 7 of 11 patients with predicted posterior probabilities ? 0.3 died of relapse or treatment-related mortality after transplantation versus only 1 of 6 with a predicted posterior probability < 0.3 (OR = 9).

The NIH LINCS project is generating millions of experiments, measuring the cell\'s response to drug and genetic perturbations. We work with other investigators in the LINCS consortium to develop computational methods and tools to build predictive models of complex diseases and drug responses.   Network inference from diverse genomics data: Interactions among genes and their gene products comprise a regulatory network. The goal of network inference is to generate testable hypotheses of gene-to-gene influences and subsequently design bench experiments to confirm network predictions. In the November 2011 issue of PNAS, Yeung and colleagues presented a methodology to construct gene regulatory networks from time series expression data in yeast, integrating various types of external biological knowledge available from public repositories. We generated microarray data measuring time-dependent gene-expression levels in 95 genotyped yeast segregants subjected to a drug perturbation. Our algorithm is capable of generating feedback loops and we showed that the inferred network recovered existing and novel regulatory relationships. In addition, we generated independent microarray data on selected deletion mutants to prospectively test network predictions. Related work: BMC Systems Biology 2012, BMC Systems Biology 2014 Nov 2013: Our proposal \"Inference of Gene Networks Studying Human Cancers On The Cloud\" won Microsoft\'s Windows Azure for Research Award.   From computational discoveries to translational research: The development of genetic predictors of clinical outcomes contributes to risk assessment in personalized medicine. In collaboration with Dr. Jerry Radich and Dr. Vivian Oehler at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, we aim to develop computational models that can predict patient responses to therapy at diagnosis, which allow us to tailor therapy to individual patients of chonic myeloid leukemia (CML). We have previously applied Bayesian Model Averaging to a gene expression data studying the progression of CML, and identified 6 predictive genes in Blood 2009. Building on this work, we developed a network-driven approach that uses expert knowledge and predicted functional relationships to guide our search for signature genes in the March 2012 issue of Bioinformatics. We showed that our gene signatures of advanced phase CML are predictive of relapse even after adjustment for known risk factors associated with transplant outcomes.   Pattern discovery and feature selection: I have also contributed to the development and application of pattern discovery and feature selection in computational biology, including clustering algorithms and supervised learning methods.Warning: The NCBI web site requires JavaScript to function. more...

Construction of regulatory networks using expression time-series data of a genotyped population. Yeung KY1, Dombek KM, Lo K, Mittler JE, Zhu J, Schadt EE, Bumgarner RE, Raftery AE. Author information 1Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. Abstract The inference of regulatory and biochemical networks from large-scale genomics data is a basic problem in molecular biology. The goal is to generate testable hypotheses of gene-to-gene influences and subsequently to design bench experiments to confirm these network predictions. Coexpression of genes in large-scale gene-expression data implies coregulation and potential gene-gene interactions, but provide little information about the direction of influences. Here, we use both time-series data and genetics data to infer directionality of edges in regulatory networks: time-series data contain information about the chronological order of regulatory events and genetics data allow us to map DNA variations to variations at the RNA level. We generate microarray data measuring time-dependent gene-expression levels in 95 genotyped yeast segregants subjected to a drug perturbation. We develop a Bayesian model averaging regression algorithm that incorporates external information from diverse data types to infer regulatory networks from the time-series and genetics data. Our algorithm is capable of generating feedback loops. We show that our inferred network recovers existing and novel regulatory relationships. Following network construction, we generate independent microarray data on selected deletion mutants to prospectively test network predictions. We demonstrate the potential of our network to discover de novo transcription-factor binding sites. Applying our construction method to previously published data demonstrates that our method is competitive with leading network construction algorithms in the literature.

We used a supervised framework to compute the probabilities of transcriptional regulation by integrating external data sources. Our goal is to infer the parent nodes (regulators) for each gene g in a regression framework. The probabilities computed in the supervised step were used to constrain potential regulators for gene g. Subsequently, a variable selection algorithm (iBMA) was applied to these candidate regulators using the time-series expression data. Specifically, the expression levels of putative regulators at the previous time point were used to predict the expression level of the gene of interest at the current time point.

Integrating external biological knowledge in the construction of regulatory networks from time-series expression data. Lo K1, Raftery AE, Dombek KM, Zhu J, Schadt EE, Bumgarner RE, Yeung KY. Author information 1Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Box 358070, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. Abstract BACKGROUND: Inference about regulatory networks from high-throughput genomics data is of great interest in systems biology. We present a Bayesian approach to infer gene regulatory networks from time series expression data by integrating various types of biological knowledge. RESULTS: We formulate network construction as a series of variable selection problems and use linear regression to model the data. Our method summarizes additional data sources with an informative prior probability distribution over candidate regression models. We extend the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) variable selection method to select regulators in the regression framework. We summarize the external biological knowledge by an informative prior probability distribution over the candidate regression models. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate our method on simulated data and a set of time-series microarray experiments measuring the effect of a drug perturbation on gene expression levels, and show that it outperforms leading regression-based methods in the literature.

Young WC, Raftery AE, Yeung KY1. Author information 1Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Box 357735, 98195-7735, Seattle WA, USA. kayee@uw.edu. Abstract BACKGROUND: Genome-wide time-series data provide a rich set of information for discovering gene regulatory relationships. As genome-wide data for mammalian systems are being generated, it is critical to develop network inference methods that can handle tens of thousands of genes efficiently, provide a systematic framework for the integration of multiple data sources, and yield robust, accurate and compact gene-to-gene relationships. RESULTS: We developed and applied ScanBMA, a Bayesian inference method that incorporates external information to improve the accuracy of the inferred network. In particular, we developed a new strategy to efficiently search the model space, applied data transformations to reduce the effect of spurious relationships, and adopted the g-prior to guide the search for candidate regulators. Our method is highly computationally efficient, thus addressing the scalability issue with network inference. The method is implemented as the ScanBMA function in the networkBMA Bioconductor software package. CONCLUSIONS: We compared ScanBMA to other popular methods using time series yeast data as well as time-series simulated data from the DREAM competition. We found that ScanBMA produced more compact networks with a greater proportion of true positives than the competing methods. Specifically, ScanBMA generally produced more favorable areas under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall curves than other regression-based methods and mutual-information based methods. In addition, ScanBMA is competitive with other network inference methods in terms of running time.

Upcoming Seminars: December 2, 2014, 4:00 PM, HSB T-639 Manuela Raffatellu, Ph.D. Associate Professor Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics School of Medicine University of California at Irvine \"Guts, Germs and Steel: Microbes and Metal in the Inflamed Gut\" Mucosal surfaces are often the first interface between the host, the commensal microbiota and pathogenic microorganisms. Among the most complex of these environments is the gut mucosa, where trillions of bacteria (the commensal microbiota) coexist with the host in a mutually beneficial equilibrium. Infection with enteric pathogens like Salmonella Typhimurium disrupts this equilibrium by causing intestinal inflammation, a response that suppresses the growth of the commensal microbiota and favors the growth of S. Typhimurium by several mechanisms. Infection with S. Typhimurium results in the upregulation of antimicrobial proteins that inhibit bacterial growth by limiting the availability of essential nutrients, including metal ions, in a process termed “nutritional immunity”. My lab studies the mechanisms by which S. Typhimurium evades nutritional immunity and acquires metal ions in the inflamed gut, allowing this pathogen to successfully compete with the microbiota for these essential nutrients. December 9, 2014, 4:00 PM, HSB T-639 Raul Andino, Ph.D. Professor Microbiology and Immunology University of California San Francisco \"RNA Virus Population Dynamics: Mechanisms of Replication and Adaptation\" Identifying the rules that govern viral evolution and adaptation is a fundamental challenge in virology and is key to understanding viral pathogenesis and spread. The rapid evolution of RNA viruses underlies the emergence of new infectious agents and gives rise to strains that are resistant to antivirals and vaccines. Optimal genomic diversity is required for adaptation, because diversity is required for adaptation but there is a limit to the maximum possible variability of viral genetic information, beyond which the genetic identity is lost and the population is no longer viable. To determine the genetic composition of the population, we have developed a novel sequencing strategy that enables us to detect rare mutational events with unprecedented accuracy. We have collected information on RNA virus population mutation and phenotype distributions. This massive information was used to develop a number of computational tools and mathematical models that provide global information about population structure, mutational and fitness landscape, mutational robustness and their relationship to function and adaptation. Our data define the population structure and its dynamics of an evolving virus population and provides mechanistic information on virus adaptation and pathogenesis. Global fitness maps were then used to identify epistatic interaction networks, which facilitate structure function predictions and uncover viral protein-protein interactions. Examining the effect of temperature and multiplicity of infection on virus proteins and RNA secondary structure provides additional insights into the viral fitness function.               Z<< Prev || Next >>   MICROBIOLOGY TRAINING FACULTY: Select One Roger Bumgarner James Champoux Edward Clark Brad Cookson Lawrence Corey Richard Darveau Michael Emerman Ferric Fang Deborah Fuller Denise Galloway Adam Geballe Pete Greenberg Caroline Harwood Shiu-Lok Hu Keith Jerome Michael Katze Michael Lagunoff John Leigh Mary Lidstrom Maxine Linial Houra Merrikh Sam Miller John Mittler Steve Moseley Joseph Mougous James Mullins Matthew Parsek Lalita Ramakrishnan Nina Salama Ram Samudrala Pradeep Singh Jason Smith Evgeni Sokurenko David Stahl Beth Traxler Joshua Woodward   ABOUT SEATTLE: www.seattle.gov | www. visit seattle.org       Department of Microbiology · University of Washington · Box 357735 · Seattle WA 98195-7735 · phone: (206) 543-5824 · fax: (206) 543-8297 · micro@u.washington.edu      We use cookies to enhance your experience on our website.

Abstract Motivation: Selecting a small number of signature genes for accurate classification of samples is essential for the development of diagnostic tests. However, many genes are highly correlated in gene expression data, and hence, many possible sets of genes are potential classifiers. Because treatment outcomes are poor in advanced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we hypothesized that expression of classifiers of advanced phase CML when detected in early CML [chronic phase (CP) CML], correlates with subsequent poorer therapeutic outcome. Results: We developed a method that integrates gene expression data with expert knowledge and predicted functional relationships using iterative Bayesian model averaging. Applying our integrated method to CML, we identified small sets of signature genes that are highly predictive of disease phases and that are more robust and stable than using expression data alone. The accuracy of our algorithm was evaluated using cross-validation on the gene expression data. We then tested the hypothesis that gene sets associated with advanced phase CML would predict relapse after allogeneic transplantation in 176 independent CP CML cases. Our gene signatures of advanced phase CML are predictive of relapse even after adjustment for known risk factors associated with transplant outcomes.

Log inWalter L. Ruzzo Professor, Computer Science & Engineering Adjunct Professor, Genome Sciences Joint Member, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Larry Ruzzo, Professor, received a B.S. (in Mathematics) from the California Institute of Technology in 1968, his Ph.D. (Computer Science) from the University of California at Berkeley in 1978, and has been with the University of Washington since 1977. Currently, his principal research project involves the construction and programming of a vaguely parallel computer, consisting of 32 steam-powered Turing machines installed in the basement of Sieg Hall. Of particular interest is the use of triple-expansion bypass valves, coupled to individual governors on each engine, to achieve write-synchronization of the machines. Graduate students have played an important role in the construction and operation of the engine, particularly in stoking the boilers, and advanced undergraduates are occasionally allowed to polish the brass gauges. Originally intended as a general computing engine, restrictions imposed by the Pollution Control and Noise Abatement Boards require that only algorithms running in polynomial time may be used. The project recently suffered another setback when one of Professor Ruzzo\'s graduate students slipped on a mouldering stack of ungraded homework exercises and fell under the write head of one of the machines. Now permanently embossed with a series of 1\'s and 0\'s, the student is suing to have the machine dismantled. When not blowing off steam, he also pursues research in computational biology as part of the CSE department\'s Computational and Synthetic Biology Group , as well as participating in graduate training through the interdisciplinary graduate program in Computational Molecular Biology and, of course, undergraduate and graduate education in Computer Science & Engineering.

The derivation of diagnostic markers of chronic myeloid leukemia progression from microarray data. Oehler VG1, Yeung KY, Choi YE, Bumgarner RE, Raftery AE, Radich JP. Author information 1Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. voehler@u.washington.edu Abstract Currently, limited molecular markers exist that can determine where in the spectrum of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progression an individual patient falls at diagnosis. Gene expression profiles can predict disease and prognosis, but most widely used microarray analytical methods yield lengthy gene candidate lists that are difficult to apply clinically. Consequently, we applied a probabilistic method called Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to a large CML microarray dataset. BMA, a supervised method, considers multiple genes simultaneously and identifies small gene sets. BMA identified 6 genes (NOB1, DDX47, IGSF2, LTB4R, SCARB1, and SLC25A3) that discriminated chronic phase (CP) from blast crisis (BC) CML. In CML, phase labels divide disease progression into discrete states. BMA, however, produces posterior probabilities between 0 and 1 and predicts patients in \"intermediate\" stages. In validation studies of 88 patients, the 6-gene signature discriminated early CP from late CP, accelerated phase, and BC. This distinction between early and late CP is not possible with current classifications, which are based on known duration of disease. BMA is a powerful tool for developing diagnostic tests from microarray data. Because therapeutic outcomes are so closely tied to disease phase, these probabilities can be used to determine a risk-based treatment strategy at diagnosis.

A summary of our overall approach is shown. The merits of BMA include that the model is multivariate and considers multiple biomarkers simultaneously; that the uncertainty of gene selection is accounted for by averaging over multiple good models; that posterior probabilities are generated for all selected genes and models; and that it produces a high predictive accuracy with relatively few genes.

This figure illustrates the membership of the 6 signature genes in the 21 models selected by the iterative BMA algorithm on the CML progression microarray data. The 6 signature genes are shown on the vertical axis, whereas the 21 models are shown in the horizontal axis. The widths of the columns are proportional to the posterior probabilities of the selected models. A red entry indicates that the corresponding gene is included in a given model.

Figure 3 Differential gene expression of the 6-gene signature in patient cases. Heatmaps of the 6-gene signature selected by the iterative BMA algorithm. (A) Heatmap of the gene expression of the 6-gene signature in the training set of CP and BC CML cases using microarray-based gene expression analyses. (B) Heatmap of the gene expression in the test set, also by microarray-based gene expression analyses. This group is made up of AP by cytogenetic criteria only (AP cyto); AP by cytogenetic and blast count criteria (AP); and BC after a return to second CP (BC-rem). Green indicates differentially decreased expression of each gene in each case compared with its expression in a pool of CP patient samples and red indicates differentially increased expression. The more saturated the color, the greater is the degree of differential expression. (C) A graphic depiction of the predicted posterior probability of all patient samples is shown. The samples are represented on the horizontal axis, whereas the predicted probabilities are represented on the vertical axis. For the training data consisting of 72 CP (group 0) and BC (group 1) cases, the average predicted probabilities over 100 cross validation runs are shown. For the test data, composed of 21 patients before allogeneic transplantation, the predicted probabilities of the 6 signature genes averaged over 21 models are shown. This “intermediate phase” test set is composed of group 2 AP by cytogenetic criteria only; group 3 AP by cytogenetic and blast count criteria; and group 4 BC after a return to second CP. For 17 of 21 patients, posttransplantation outcomes were available. Using a posterior probability threshold of 0.3, we found that 7 of 11 patients with predicted posterior probabilities ? 0.3 died of relapse or treatment-related mortality after transplantation versus only 1 of 6 with a predicted posterior probability < 0.3 (OR = 9).

Travelling on land, in the sea or in the air, UVSs come in a wide variety of configurations. Some are small and tactical, while others are large and strategic. This diversity has naturally led to the interoperability problem between UVSs developed by difference organizations or companies. Aiming at an open architecture for UVSs, Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS) was originally initiated by the Department of Defense and is now maintained by the unmanned technical committee of the Society of Automotive Engineers . An emerging standard for messaging within and between UVSs, JAUS enhances code modularity and enables code reuse, leading to more rapid, less costly development and decreased deployment expense.   For autonomous UVSs, communication is necessary and essential in accomplishing complex mission tasks; it becomes especially important in cooperative missions where tasks are solved using many vehicles of different sizes and characteristics with different sensor suites. Smartphone technology offers an interesting communication infrastructure for remotely accessing, controlling and interacting with UVSs in an integrated and highly portable manner, and offers the ability to have an interface to the World Wide Web (WWW) for additional information useful in mission achievement. Smartphone technology is mature enough to begin experimentation and research into their integration with UVSs and their use in complex mission scenarios.   The purpose of this research is to apply open source software to the development of a testbed for UVSs with smartphone as communication media; within and between UVSs, JAUS standard would be implemented for message passing. The feasibility of using open source software, namely, OpenJAUS , in designing, developing and deploying UVSs will be investigated; Google Android  will be used to build applications such as streaming video from UVSs, sending snapshots of targets to the central station, via smartphone; the performance robustness and security issues will also be examined.     2.      Hardware Implementation of Multi-rate Model Predictive Control   Nowadays, micro-needles have been created to painlessly cross the uppermost layer of the skin to effectively, efficiently, and painlessly deliver drugs to depths as shallow as 1mm. It is the trend to develop small and compact drug delivery devices that can maximize the therapeutic results of a drug. Considering the human organism, which is one of the most complex dynamical systems, the drug delivery system needs an advanced control scheme to handle the inherent existence of nonlinearities, constraints, patient variability, multi-rates, and delays. Multi-rate MPC is a suitable candidate.   One example where multi-rate concept is useful is the drug delivery control problem to regulate the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output (CO) for heart attack patients. CO measurements typically are available every 2-3 minutes, and MAP can be measured as often as every 30 seconds. The need for an explicit multi-rate control scheme arises because the settling time criteria may not be met if all measurements are slowed down to correspond to the CO sampling rate. Model Predictive Control (MPC) was originally developed in the late 1970s. More recently, there have been considerable interests in expanding the applicability of MPC to systems which were traditionally considered unsuitable for MPC due to their small physical size and fast dynamics. As an example, MPC can be used to regulate the blood glucose concentration of a diabetic by injecting insulin according to dynamic measurements of glucose concentration.   Advances in the semiconductor technology and in computer architecture have enabled the integration of enough computational power on a chip, to solve efficiently MPC problems in real time. Motivated by all these research achievement, and the need for a scalable and low-cost embedded multi-rate MPC algorithm for applications like the drug delivery system, this research will focus on the hardware implementation of multi-rate MPC. The research mainly has two objectives. The first objective is to implement the multi-rate MPC on general-purpose microprocessors. The second objective is to implement multi-rate MPC onto FPGAs (Field-programmable gate array).  '),(375,'Welcome to My Web Page Bonus points to whoever  guesses the location of this building.'),(376,'This is the web page for D.

Life. They are one and the same; without water, there is no life. A century ago, a dryland farmer on the Great Plains would have understood that analogy perfectly, it\'s truth would be evident and undeniable. Today, that connection is harder to see, development and modern technologies have clouded our ability to observe as carefully. However, the analogy is still just as true now as then; we, along with every other organism on earth, need clean, fresh water every day to sustain our existence and quality of life. What\'s more, clean water is scarce and becoming scarcer. Population growth and development often result in the contamination and pollution of our water supplies, which limits our water supply and decreases its water quality. Therefore, to maintain our current quality of life and to preserve the integrity of the ecosystem that we are a part of, we need to insure that we have adequate, high quality water supplies.',1),(197,'koontz31','Koontz, Tom',' Tom','Koontz','Associate Professor','Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, School of','253-692-4311','koontz31@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/koontz31/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(198,'jkott','Kott, Jordan',' Jordan','Kott','Lecturer','Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, School of','253-692-4450','jkott@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/jkott/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(199,'kucher','Kucher, Michael',' Michael','Kucher','Associate Professor','Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, School of','253-692-5839','kucher@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/kucher/',1,1,'medieval; water; supply; siena; italy; fur; trade; aquatic; ecosystem; pacific; northwest; landscape; mima; mound; thurston; county; washington; Environment ; ecology; conservation; technology; aqueducts;  \n','medieval; water; supply; siena; italy; fur; trade; aquatic; ecosystem; pacific; northwest; landscape; mima; mound; thurston; county; washington; Environment ; ecology; conservation; technology; aqueducts;  \n','Michael Kucher, Ph.D. \nAssistant Professor, History of Technology and the Environment.\nUniversity of Washington, Tacoma\n1900 Commerce Street\nTacoma WA 98402 USA\n253-692-5839\nkucher at u dot washington dot edu\n\nCurrent Research:\nThe medieval water supply of Siena, Italy.\nThe impact of the fur trade on aquatic ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest.\nLandscape history of the Mima mounds, Thurston County, Washington.\nTeaching:\nProgram on the Environment  ENVIR201 Ecology and Conservation:  Humans in the Environment\nMy courses at UW Tacoma related to Technology and the Environment.\nLinks:\nMedieval Aqueducts of Siena, Italy (North American mirror for the Museum of Water in Siena, Italy)\nAquae Urbis Romae: the Waters of the City of Rome (Katherine Wentworth Rinne\'s very cool project)\nIHWA  International Water History Association',1),(200,'mkula','Kula, Michael',' Michael','Kula','Assistant Professor','Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, School of','253-692-4755','mkula@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/mkula/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(201,'bkunz','Kunz, Bill',' Bill','Kunz','Associate Professor','Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, School of','253-692-4450','bkunz@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/bkunz/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(202,'anniekuo','Kuo, Annie',' Annie','Kuo','Lecturer','Education','253-692-4430','anniekuo@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/anniekuo/',1,1,'podcasts; secondary; EOL; classroom; engagement; language; practice; \n','podcasts; secondary; EOL; classroom; engagement; language; practice; \n','Utlizing Podcasts in Secondary ESOL Classrooms: \nPromoting Engagement and Second Language Practice\nHome | Unit Outline | Podcasting Software | Grading Rubric | Sample Reading | Sample Podcasts | Other Resources |\nThis website can be used as a resource for ESOL instructors of middle and high school students in incorporating technology in the classroom \nwhile practicing different aspects of English.

My research explores science and culture with a focus on public cultures of science (museums, curricula, zines, science fiction, etc.). Recent research has examined how understanding the history of the use of humans in scientific research might inform the curriculum, student resistance to creativity in science, and the nature of science literacy in the context of struggles for social justice\nIn addition to my research, I run the secondary science program at UWT. We offer endorsements in biology, earth science, and general science. Our program educates students in multiple approaches to \"inquiry,\" i.e., helping students explore nature through a scientific process and a science-and-society approach which emphasizes teaching to help young people make informed decisions and struggle for a more democratic world.\n',0),(358,'jawit','Weiss, Jeff',' Jeff','Weiss','Part-time Lecturer','Institute of Technology','253-692-5860','jawit@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/jawit/',1,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(359,'wellerp','Weller, Patrick',' Patrick','Weller','Lecturer','Milgard School of Business','253-692-5732','wellerp@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/wellerp/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(360,'atw5','Wessells, Anne Taufen',' Anne Taufen','Wessells','Assistant Professor','Urban Studies','253-692-4319','atw5@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/atw5/',1,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(361,'carwest','West, Carolyn',' Carolyn','West','Associate Professor','Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, School of','253-692-5652','carwest@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/carwest/',1,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(362,'jejw','West, James',' James','West','Part-time Lecturer','Institute of Technology','253-692-5860','jejw@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/jejw/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(363,'wibowo','Wibowo, Ko',' Ko','Wibowo','Part-time Lecturer','Urban Studies','253-692-5880','wibowo@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/wibowo/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(364,'jimherb','Williams, James',' James','Williams','Part-time Lecturer','Social Work','253-692-5820','jimherb@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/jimherb/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(365,'willid6','Williams, Dorothy P.',' Dorothy P.','Williams','Educationnal Administration Field Supervisor','Education','253-692-4430','willid6@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/willid6/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(366,'charles1','Williams, Charles',' Charles','Williams','PPPA Division Chair and Associate Professor','Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, School of','253-692-4790','charles1@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/charles1/',1,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(367,'dtwills','Wills, Doug',' Doug','Wills','Associate Professor','Milgard School of Business','253-692-5626','dtwills@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/dtwills/',1,1,'Microeconomics; Macroeconomics; Markets\n','Property rights; Microeconomics; Dividend; Discount; Cattle Markets; Markets; revaluation; Amsterdam Market; Homestead Claims; Western Settlement; Western Plains: Johnson County; War; Thomas Edison; Monetary Option; Stationary Condition; AR Index Process; Black Gold; Bretton Woods; Oil Price; monetary views; Arthus Kitson; Revolution; Restoration; Debt Repudiation; Jacobite Threat; England; Institutions; Economic Growth; Feature Analysis; Amsterdam; Financial Markets; Reversion Level; Agenda-Setter; Public Debt; Interest; Fiscal Incidence; Fiscal Illusion; Grantor; Government; Canada;\n','\nHome | Classes | Papers | About\nDouglas Wills, Ph.D., CFA\n304_Doug_WillsAssociate Professor of Economics\nUniversity of Washington, Tacoma\n1900 Commerce St. CB 358420\nTacoma, WA\n98402-3100\n\nOffice: Dougan 324\nPh: 253-692-5626\nFax: 253-692-4523\n\nemail: dtwills@uw.edu\n\nCurriculum Vita\nÂ© 2014 Douglas Wills Contact Me\n',1),(368,'aawilso','Wilson, Alexis',' Alexis','Wilso','Principal Lecturer; Clinical Assistant Professor','Nursing & Healthcare Leadership','253-692-4478','aawilson@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/aawilson/',1,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(369,'workmg','Workman, Gloria',' Gloria','Workma','Part-time Lecturer','Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, School of','253-692-5732','workmg@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/workmg/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(370,'workmde','Workman, Don',' Don','Workma','Part-time Lecturer','Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, School of','253-692-5732','workmde@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/workmde/',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(371,'kayee','Yeung, Ka Yee',' Ka Yee','Yeung','Associate Professor','Institute of Technology','253-692-4924','kayee@uw.edu','http://faculty.washington.edu/kayee/',1,1,'Computational Biology\n','Computational Biology; Gene Networks; Pattern discovery; Feature selection; Bayesian Model Averaging methods; Bayesian Inference; regulatory networks; time-series; Gene Expression ; ; Pattern Recognition; Clustering;\n','Home page of Ka Yee Yeung\nI am an Associate Professor in the Institute of Technology at University of Washington - Tacoma, and an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Microbiology at University of Washington - Seattle.
